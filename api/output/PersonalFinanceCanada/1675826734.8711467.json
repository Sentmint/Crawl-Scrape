The sender has comment history in this sub and this is the only Canadian-based sub I regularly post comments to. Here's what I received:\n\n***\"Hey HolyGourdofJerusalem,  Hope you\u2019re doing well. I\u2019m just reaching out to various ambitious people to see if they\u2019d be interested in earning some additional income.  If you are open to learning something new, I think you would potentially be a good fit.  Our company is expanding fast all across Canada and ambitious people with good leadership skills are seen as a huge asset.  We are in the financial education and wealth management business- a New York Stock Exchange company.  We essentially help middle/lower class families build financial security and eliminate debt.  Our system not only helps the client but can produce some residual income for you as well.  Experience in the industry is not required as we will provide all training. Part time/ remote work is available with lots of room for growth - a very respectable side hustle.  Let me know if you or anyone you know is interested.  Take care\"***\n\nThis is a standard pitch from Primerica, a financial MLM that churns through recruits (usually new immigrants and always the financially illiterate) while selling them overpriced term life insurance and expensive mutual funds, then using these people to refer them to friends and family, under the guise of training.\n\nIf he's sending this to me, he's sending it to others. \n\nMy response (feel free to copy/paste and adjust to your taste/circumstances should you be solicited yourself):\n\n***There is nothing respectable about selling egregiously overpriced term life insurance and mutual funds to financially ignorant people and using people for their contact lists under the guise of training so that your upline can take advantage of them. I'm not interested in a side hustle (I'm already financially independent) nor am I interested in joining an MLM cult.*** \n\nMods, if you want the username, feel free to DM me and I can send a screen-shot.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10vzgls/psa_pfcers_be_aware_primerica_agents_recruiting/", "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10vzgls/psa_pfcers_be_aware_primerica_agents_recruiting/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10vzgls", "author": "t2_4f2k45n8", "commentCount": 225, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_cj3z9bdi", "body": "When a recruiter needs to tell you the job is \"very respectable\", it is probably not at all respectable.", "created_utc": 1675774976.0, "edited": 1675784859.0, "id": "j7kee6r", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10vzgls/psa_pfcers_be_aware_primerica_agents_recruiting/j7kee6r/", "score": 384, "ups": 384}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_d10fa", "body": "My favourite part about the message is that they go out of their way to state: \n\n> We are in the financial education and wealth management business- a New York Stock Exchange company.\n\nHowever, they don't at any point mention what the name of the business is.

They were relatively new to the company so when they brought me over to do their pitch they had their 'boss' with them for assistance. I spent the next 75 minutes picking apart every little thing, pointing out how stupid you'd have to be to not realize it's blatantly a pyramid scheme. It would have \"been so easy for me to take home 5-figure weekly salaries\" while I was in university, as long as I ignored the fact I was trying to scam my fellow students... The 'boss' even showed me some deposits into their bank account for that kind of money, they just happened to leave out the part where they'd already scammed about 300 other people into policies and another 50 or so into 'working' for them, until I asked about what it takes to get that kind of income. I noped out of there really fucking hard. I almost died laughing when I said \"sooo, this is a pyramid scheme?\" and the 'boss' almost fell over themselves trying to defend and explain how it's \"not a pyramid scheme, because you recruit people and sell products, and then you get a kick-back on everything your recruits sell, eventually you don't even have to work and you make 6-figures!\"\n\nThat person I knew really gave it a go for about 7 years. Even rented some office space to look more \"professional.\" One day I noticed they had a new full-time job at a local factory so I asked about the Primerica... they had to file bankruptcy because they poured nearly their entire life savings into trying to make a career out of a pyramid scheme.

But if you recruit someone you get a small cut of their sales... And if *they* recruit people, you also get a small cut of *their* sales. So eventually if you build a sales pyramid big enough you're making commissions on like 1000 people below you. It's not a pyramid scheme in the textbook sense, it's just pyramid *like*. What they're selling is a perfectly legal, normal product.\n\nPeople call them pyramid schemes but that's technically not true. MLMs are pyramid shaped but they're not pyramid schemes.\n\nWhere the problem comes in is that until you get to that point you make shit money (less than min wage). So like 95% of people quit in the first 6 months. So you have to be recruiting like 30-40 people at a *minimum*. And then those people need to recruit like mad, and then those people need to recruit like mad, etc.\n\nSo to be successful and have a strong pyramid below you, you will have had to recruit like 100,000 people. Some places have done the math and for a city of 1m people you can only have a few successful people in that given market.\n\nHence it's all about recruiting. You have to recruit like a man man, and they in turn have to recruit like crazy, and have to hire crazy recruiters to work under them.\n\nAt least with Primerica it's not a physical product.

The company had restructured and made working a nightmare, so I left shortly after him and was hunting for work. He had a son, about my daughters age and invited our family to come to the private, community provided splash park he had access too one weekend. We went, it was fun and that was that. It did start raining extremely hard and storming, so we left early and I assume they couldn't pitch properly. About a week later he asked me out for a coffee, but another friend/co-worker had pre-warned me that he was an Amway rep. I show up, he makes small talks then jumps into the pitch. I wasn't interested and we haven't talked since.  \n\n\nThe second time was way more insulting and happened maybe a month after the first. I had applied to a mysteriously vague job posting for \"Sales Managers\" on some website. While I used linkedin for most of my applications I also liked to explore other sites. I had found linkedin to be the chop shop recruiters favored tool, while other sites sometimes worked better. I apply for this role, with no expectations. I got a call back within a day, but the connection sucked (turns out it didn't) and this person apologizes and texts me, arranging a meeting and sends me an email about the meeting to go to a specific hotel. I know the hotel and they have a decent bar/lounge, so figured that was why. I was wrong. I show up, suit/tie, talk to the manager who was a previous customer and such, then I noticed a flood of people in tshirts or golf shirts, suspiciously energetic music etc. This guy shows up, with his wife and is trying to recruit me for some financial services scheme. Don't know what it was. He brings me to \"his boss\". Now, the guy trying to recruit me can barely speak english, he wife is dressed in some extravagant but traditional looking African outfit, he has a suit on. His boss, is wearing a platinum colored suit, black silk shirt and has absolutely massive, diamond studs in his ears. It was a bit of an over the top, look and he was greasy. The way he carried himself, the way he talked. I sized him up, he did the same to me and within 30 seconds he knew he wasn't recruiting me and I wasn't interested. I left a minute later.  \n\n\nThe final time was about a year later. A mutual coworker mention he worked with some financial services thing, pushed it hard on Linkedin messages to me, then told the recruiter for my area to reach out. I wasn't interested and told both that, but they still tried for a few weeks until I just stopped responding.   \n\n\nIt really is shocking the tactics they go through.

If you seriously want to know more it's on you to educate yourself. You've taken one concept, Browser fingerprinting, and extrapolated an incorrect use case.\n\nBrowser fingerprinting is a very real privacy concern, and mostly came about because users were blocking or clearing cookies (or using incognito mode). However the users are passive in this case, and fingerprinting is not perfect, but \"good enough\" when taken across a large swathe of users.\n\nThe information collected is done so either via scripts or HTTP headers. All of which originates from or round-trips through the users Browser. It is encrypted *only* as it's sent from the Browser - before that the user is free to view or modify it anyway they want. Download a free intercepting proxy and play for yourself if you wish, Burp Suite is pretty much the gold standard for pentesters currently. This means that the user (AKA the person you want to \"hardware ban\") chooses exactly what the server (AKA Reddit) gets to receive. If they don't want to send the \"fingerprint\" (however it may be generated) they are free remove or edit it as they wish.\n\nSo in short, Fingerprinting can be used for passive tracking with a reasonable success rate, but you cannot rely on it as a security control where the nefarious user is actively trying to circumvent it.\n\nNow a \"hardware ban\" would infer that a piece of information tied to the client-side hardware is being transmitted and cannot be altered by our nefarious user. Either because it's encrypted or digitally signed. However this is only possible in a closed system where the end user can't access / modify before the cryptographic operations take place, which is the case for a uncracked games console.

For singles, an average lifestyle ($43K) needs $810K to retire at 60 and $510K to retire at 67; a deluxe single ($80K) needs $1.8M to retire at 60 and $1.4M to retire at 67.\n\nThe book gives the arithmetic supporting these conclusions. But for a quick example, for the 'basic' lifestyle ($42K) couple: the author assumes each person gets $18K/year in CPP and OAS, which totals $36K just from government benefits. This is a pretty reasonable assumption, as the average OAS is $600/mo and the average CPP is $700/mo, for $1300/mo ($15,600/year):\n\n* https://www.qtrade.ca/en/investor/education/investing-articles/financial-literacy/how-much-will-your-oas-benefit-be.html\n* https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/learn/how-much-cpp-retirement\n\nGetting to $18K is not a stretch, if (a) you get a little above average, and (b) get more by delay taking the benefit to >65. For a couple, that is $36K per year, so getting to the desired $42K is \"just\" another $6K per year. With the common \"safe withdrawal rate\" of 4% we get $6K\u00f74% = $150K retirement nest egg.\n\nSome older article by the author:\n\n* https://pmac.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/07-02-series-aritcle-1-Aston-David-What-s-Your-Magic-Number.pdf\n* https://www.macleans.ca/economy/money-economy/heres-the-real-cost-of-retirement-happiness/\n\nFred Vettese, a now-retired actuary, also has two good books with similar conclusions:\n\n* https://lifeworks.com/en/resource/essential-retirement-guide-contrarians-perspective\n* https://lifeworks.com/en/resource/retirement-income-life\n\nVettese also just released a new book last year for those in the 20-40 age range on balancing major life expenses during that time period (mortgage/rent, kids/daycare, retirement):\n\n* https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/retired-money/the-rule-of-30/\n* https://www.myownadvisor.ca/the-rule-of-30-review/\n* https://boomerandecho.com/the-rule-of-30-book-review/\n\nSee:\n\n* /r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/reading-list\n\nCheck your local library.", "created_utc": 1675788599.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7l9box", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10w3jsh/bmo_survey_indicates_canadians_think_they_need/j7l9box/", "score": 12, "ups": 12}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_14qydy", "body": "I think people both underestimate and overestimate how much they need to retire.

For most folks $2M is 2x or even maybe 4x of what they need. The 2020 book *The Sleep-Easy Retirement Guide* has good numerical examples:\n\n* https://findependencehub.com/qa-with-author-david-aston-about-his-new-book-the-sleepeasy-guide-to-retirement/\n\nIn Table 5-1, he lists some real-life example of couples spending, with the average basics (shelter, groceries, vehicles, etc) totalling CA$ 42K and with average extras (entertainment, travel, etc) going to CA$ 72K. A \"modest\" couple spends CA$ 56K per year, and an \"affluent\" example couple spends $112K. In Table 5-2 he does the same thing for single retirees: the average single retiree spends $27K on basics and with extras $42K total; an \"affluent\" single retiree spends $90K.\n\nThen in Table 12-1 he lists what nest egg is needed for each of those: a couple with a modest income needs of $42K needs to have $420K saved to retire at age 60 and $150K to retire at age 67. A deluxe lifestyle couple ($100K) needs $2M saved to retire at 60, and $1.3M to retired at 67. For singles, an average lifestyle ($43K) needs $810K to retire at 60 and $510K to retire at 67; a deluxe single ($80K) needs $1.8M to retire at 60 and $1.4M to retire at 67.", "created_utc": 1675788790.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7l9tj1", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10w3jsh/bmo_survey_indicates_canadians_think_they_need/j7l9tj1/", "score": 3, "ups": 3}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_uoq11wmh", "body": "Is that 2 milly for a couple or alone?\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely insane- giving our current average income, for someone to put together this kind of income.

His mobility is extremely limited and his interests are watching tv and talking to neighbors. That amounts to about $40k a year out of pocket, but even that isn't accurate because most facilities will work with you budget, and then you have CPP AND OAS chipping in. So you could easily be covered on much less a year.\n\nThis is where my point shines even more.  If you're the age that you're being put into a facility that requires more complex care, and is therefore more expensive, then that is your expenses, total. You don't need money save for a Thailand trip, because you're lucky to get to the lunch counter. At that point your entire expenses are your basic needs.", "created_utc": 1675789167.0, "edited": 1675792488.0, "id": "j7lasu1", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10w3jsh/bmo_survey_indicates_canadians_think_they_need/j7lasu1/", "score": 15, "ups": 15}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_va9obcd0", "body": "They sucked over a million out of my grandmothers retirement fund before she passed from alzheimer's.

Next you're no longer saving for retirement, so any money that was going into RRSPs (which you also never saw to spend on daily things) also does not need to be replaced.\n\nIf you had a mortgage for ~20 years, you never got to spend on yourself either, so there was no habit of spending that money; and when the mortgage went away, you probably took a portion of that and started putting into retirement savings later in life.\n\nIf you had kids you spent a lot on them, especially at early ages: money that was not  spent on yourself.\n\nSo after a lifetime of spending ~50% of gross income you're going to suddenly start flashing Benjamins around?

That sounds like the best fit for you if you do love fixing things and woodworking. It is high pay per hour work, and usually evenings and weekends are requested but you can pick your own  schedule. \n\n\nSome people can't install their own ikea furniture, or just don't want to. You can offer to just do that. Or people (sometimes with disabilities but not always) need help with just installing minor things, or assembling things like furniture, or rearranging a room. Some of them have very well paying jobs and would love a handyman to call when they buy a new table and need it assembled and the old one taken away. Or if another handyman or tradesman  just needs an extra pair of hands. Often holding a ladder and gofering tools cuts a job time in third, so renting yourself out as a 1 hour to 2 day extra pair of hands without tools or experience works for people doing DIY projects or home maintenance. \n\n\nThere is most likely a tool library close to you, or an online tool rental programs that gets you access to most tools for cheap. And some give you access to a shop for bigger projects if necessary. This is a good way to start with minor repairs like fixing crooked doors (knuckle wrench and a hammer, or screws and a shim are all you need in 99% of cases).\n\n\nLaying floor vinyl plank for is easy, and if you find someone who does it also as a weekend job but knows how to do it and just needs an extra pair of hands that is a great way to learn and make money. If you can't then offering to be a spare body to someone who knows how to lay floor and will teach you for a day or two of work is a the next best way to learn. YouTube is great for that, but there are still tips and tricks that make it a professional or amateur job that are easily overlooked on YouTube. \n\n\nKnow your limits though, don't do electrical beyond replacing a switch for a switch or a light for a light. Even then I would be careful about accepting those jobs and do not advertise that you can do electrical online without a license. As for plumbing make sure you have the tools needed for that before you offer that. Some bathroom and kitchen fixtures have been there for 50+ years and are corroded. They aren't all easy to remove without risking breaking the sink. So in those cases you need to walk away from the job and give them back their money.   However replacing the gasket on a pipe above the ptrap so it doesn't leak is something a lot of people need to do and just don't know how. So they have a bucket under the sink because hiring a 100$ an hour plumber to fix it seems ridiculous to replace a 2$ part.  You could literally post a picture of a leaking gasket or ptrap on Facebook with \" is this your problem, 30$ for repair in the ____area on weekends\".   You would definitely get people asking for that repair, but I do suggest asking them for a photo of their leak and sink set up before going there, in case it is a wonky set up and would need more work than just replacing a gasket. \n\n\nPromising to be able to do more then you are able is what gets a lot of handymen bad reviews. If you can't do trim work don't do trim work until you know how and have access to the tools. Filler and caulk can't fix every mistake.  Doing it badly will hurt your reputation. \n\n\nAs for advertising your services, start with word of mouth. People are always more willing to let someone they peripherally know in their house than a stranger with no reviews on the internet. Someone's grandmother might need help with the gutters and they don't want to help so they will recommend you, someone coworker could be complaining about a sticking door and will recommend you. Advertise online on the handyman message boards on Facebook, Kijiji, etc. \n\n\nAnd Bunz trading zone on Facebook would be a good place to offer help for knowledge and experience for things like flooring. Post: Anyone need help laying vinyl plank flooring, I am looking to learn and would love to help in exchange for learning how. (1 day max). \n\n\nAnd if you don't hate it after a year and want to do it full time (and will make more money than your current job) then look into apprenticeships for cabinet making or electrical or plumbing or appliance repair. You get paid while you learn, and there are usually extra social support programs for people who want to get into trades and take courses. \n\n\n\nAnd I am not sure if this is helpful but find the local physiotherapy school and see what their rates are. That can be a way to get good physiotherapy at half the price, or do half with his normal physiotherapist and half with the school.

You can do everything in English.\n\nAs somebody working here, it depends: my friends work in IT/software development and they live all their lives in English (to the point that one of them lives with a French girl and they speak English together, not French). That includes work. They work in places where the language mainly used is English. I have heard that other domains are not that English oriented.\n\nWhile I have met my share of people that live here and have 0 intend on learning French, I do not recommend it/understand it.\n\nAlso, be aware of social/racial/tribal tensions between Anglo-Quebecois and French-Quebecois.

Just a simple oil change is about 1/3 the cost of having it done at a shop for example, but there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n1: You need tools. You may be lucky enough to have family or friends that you can borrow from or live near a tool Library, but the upfront cost of tools can definitely make for a lengthy ROI.\n\n2. You need to be mechanically inclined. Quite simply not everyone is, some people are spectacularly inept when it comes to fixing things. Strip out the drain plug and now your DIY oil change just cost 4 times what it would have cost at a shop. If you work on your own car you know it rarely goes as planned. From corrosion to broken bolts to wrong parts or lack of specialty tools, you need to be able to overcome these challenges and some people's brains just don't work that way. Getting the car towed to a shop to finish a job you couldn't complete is way more expensive than just having a pro do it in the first place. \n\n3. Is your car under warranty? If it is it's probably not worth the risk of potentially having a warranty claim denied due to lack of properly documented oil changes/maintenance. You don't need to go to the dealership, but not having all the proper paperwork can definitely cost more than you'll save if the worst were to happen. \n\n4. Be safe. This kind of ties into points 1 & 2. Trying to change your brake pads with the car up on the shitty scissor jack it came with could be disastrous both financially and physically. Botching the job could not only  put yourself and your family in danger but also the public in general. Loosing time from work, a limb, a lawsuit or your life probably isn't worth the savings of DIY. \n\nIn short, I would say that you need to have more of a reason to do your own car maintenance that just finances. You need to actually enjoy it, have an interest in it. You need to have a use for the tools you buy outside of just one specific task. Maybe it's wanting to know your car inside out, maybe it's bonding with your Dad or your buddy in the garage on the weekend, maybe you just love learning new skills in a hands on way. Whatever it is,  if it's just to save a buck, a $59 Costco oil change (I suppose it's still the same price...

Even CCs don\u2019t go that insane. In your situation, don\u2019t overthink it -> 10k on CCs with your income level is bad, but it is not horrible. It\u2019s doable. Keep that 6k @ 46% and you\u2019ll learn what is horrible and unmanageable soon enough.\n\nYou work and have an income - that\u2019s good, you\u2019ll learn a valuable lesson about debt and CCs in the process, but like I said 10k in CCs is NOT horrible. Return the 6k (I honestly would drop everything and head out to these fucks right now! Right fucking now! And shove those 6k right down their throat). After you rerun 6k, craft out a plan how you want to pay CCs out : get a second job, tighten your belt, get on food stamps / food bank, cancel any unnecessary expensive purchases, cancel streaming services, sell some of the shit that you no longer need. Set yourself a goal that you don\u2019t want to have any CC debt within a year. That should improve your credit score as well and once eligible try to obtain a line of credit (LOC). LOCs are amazing, they have bigger credit and way lower % rate than CCs (HELOCs are even better). Rule of thumb - you always want to transfer debt to the one with lowest interest rate. The opposite of what you just did, don\u2019t bring lower % into higher %. LOCs are truly amazing, but it is still a debt mechanism, so don\u2019t go crazy once you get it and waste money on truly dumb shit (I\u2019ve seen it happen and I did myself and I have regrets).\n\nThe other thing I would recommend - speak with banks. Go to all of them - RBC, CIBC, BMO, HSBC, TD - those are the big ones. Tell them your situation, maybe they\u2019ll give you a LOC now? If they\u2019ll refuse (you do have a shitty credit score), speak with credit unions. Talk only with legit financial institutions, I don\u2019t mean to defends banks or whatever - but they\u2019re heavily regulated and won\u2019t scam you like that (46% ffs). If you\u2019re young , banks may give you a LOC now , since they may want to get you as a client now so that when you will start making more money you\u2019ll get mortgages, CCs, LOCs etc. from them. Banks always play a long game, so it is very worthwhile to try it out. Worst case scenario, you\u2019ll hear a \u201cno\u201d a lot and will waste a day or so.

Alternatively, you could consider selling real estate, if you are persuasive. \n\nI think that the best way to get into real estate investing is to first buy your own house, because it is relatively easy to get financing for this, compared to for investing. Then hopefully you will build some equity, which you can use for commercial real estate investing. I have done well in real estate, but always commercial, not residential, because residential is too heavily regulated, in favor of the tenants.\n\nWith commercial real estate, the best way to buy is with a vendor take back mortgage, where the seller finances it for you. All of my commercial properties were bought with VTBs. Not all vendors will do it, but some will. It's so much easier, and they typically don't really care about your credit. Sometimes they will want a lot down, but I bought one with 10% down. You will pay a higher interest rate, but it's way less hassle.

Oaken bank is offering 3.4% right now which sounds lower *but* it's not a promotional rate so what I do is if my promotional rate at Tangerine expires, I just transfer my money into Oaken.\n\nAnyway, I would say you should try to take advantage of the interest rates right now if you are carrying a 5 figure balance.

That's not really recommended apparently, but you could put some of the money into a cashable GIC just in case, and some in a fixed rate GIC.\n\nThere's also market-linked GICs, where the interest rate you get back depends on the performance of the stock market. There's no risk, you get your full investment back, and there's a minimum gain as well, but essentially you don't know what the interest rate will be. It has a \"lower floor and higher ceiling\", i.e. Could be like half of what a fixed rate GIC is, or could be double.\n\nEither way, I'm very far from bing an expert but I think you could put a portion of your chequing account into a GIC, because it is a risk free investment and they're right that if you were gonna use the money, you might as well make some extra off it. But don't totally clear it out, keep some liquid cash for yourself. You never know when you might have some unexpected expenses (like losing a job, or needing to move urgently, or having to replace a major appliance or something).

I\u2019m in a very specialized sector. I have a BSc, vet degree, and masters in my specialty field (3 slots available per year), and I passed my specialty board certification this past summer. I've worked hard and was really excited to come back to Canada to officially start my working career. I was hired by a big Canadian company out of school and relocated to a town 5 hours from my boyfriend's city.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finances**:\n\nI currently make $118,900 (I started at $116,000 and got a 2.5% raise at the 6-month mark). I received a signing bonus of $10,000 and my moving expenses covered if I stay on for 2 years. I\u2019m salaried at 40-45 hours a week, have my CE paid for, and am given a company car for work travel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Past Year**:\n\nI\u2019ve worked with this company for a year and have struggled. I was put into a high-level role with managerial duties, which I signed on for, but it's more than I can handle. I wasn't given much mentorship or training for my role. I ended up alone on most of my first cases and dealt with some of the worst health crisis our sector has ever seen.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest on my team, but my team is inexperienced and doesn't work well together (I regularly have to meet with HR because both sides and up crying). I have some employees that need to be told how to do their jobs on a daily basis, to the point where they need checklists so things aren't missed. The one employee I had that was incredibly competent, self-sufficient, and driven ended up quitting in November - on her exit interview, she told me she was tired of working 50-60 hours without compensation. Her duties now fall under my responsibility, and I have taken them on (I'm pushing 50-60 hours per week) with no increase in pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Today**:\n\nI\u2019m absolutely miserable in a bad way. I have a rough patch in December when I was very close to wrapping my car around a telephone pole, but have since been doing better, thanks to therapy and my supportive boyfriend (who again, lives 5 hours away).\n\nI feel very much trapped because my degree is so incredibly specialized. I had professors put a lot into me, and if I quit now, I feel like I wasted the opportunities given to me in my masters.\n\nI got an offer from the government in my boyfriend's city. It's currently at $82,000, no company car, but excellent benefits and federal pension. I'd be taking a massive pay cut and need to pay back 40% of my moving expenses (I'm estimating it would cost me \\~$5,000-10,000).\n\nDebt-wise, I currently have $10,600 on my student line of credit from my education (I've paid off 50,000 this past year). I have $23,000 saved in my chequing account.\n\nI'm tight with my budget and haven't changed much since graduating from being a student (other than renting a house instead of apartment, from $1200 to $2000 per month). My boyfriend has a vehicle he'd let me use to drive to the government job, and currently makes \\~$120,000 a year at a job he loves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo I move in with him (which we both want to do sooner rather than later) and take the pay cut, or do I stick it out a bit longer, put my foot down to the overtime, and encourage my boyfriend to move in with me? He can get a job in the area.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m a veterinarian.\n\nEDIT: thank you all for your concern! I\u2019ve been doing much better lately, but I appreciate the feedback! I\u2019ve responded to the government offer to see if I can negotiate a higher rate, closer to 95k.

How you pay yourself will be important after that two years in terms of your credit worthy ness. Speak to that mortgage broker.\n\n3. Taxes. I don't actually save much on taxes. I have few deductable expenses besides the salary I pay myself. Paying dividends can salary worked out very similar. This is not the reason to do this if you stick to the letter of the law.\n\n4. I did a monster spreadsheet with estimated downtime (30%), unpaid time off, unmatched retirement contributions.\n\nWhat I found as a rule of thumb was for it to make sense for me my hourly rate should be the dollar value per hour of my yearly salary: aka, 135k/year -> 135 dollars/hr.\n\nObviously that is a very rough rule of thumb.\n\n5.

We didn't know how to use Term and Amortization that time. So, be clear that when you said 5 years, you mean 5 years amortization, not 5-year term. The Salesperson will never tell you that! Besides, when you are going to talk about financing your car, it is not the Sales Dept that will deal in signing your papers but the Finance Dept. \n\n**Here is the TERMS of REPAYMENT:**\n\n*In return for financing your purchase of the property described and related servicesand all fees related to this Agreement , you promise to pay a total of $****43,406.46.***\n\n*The total is comprised of the unpaid balance of the cash selling price of the property described and related services and all fees to be financed* ***$36,751.32*** *(the Loan) plus* ***6,655.14*** *interest of the Loan at the annual interest rate set out above.* (The interest is 4.98 per year for 60 months)\n\n*Term of Loan (months)* ***60***\\*.

They said that we have our free oil change within 5 years or 100,000km whichever comes first. We have our car for 4 years that time then and we just used 80,000km.

I asked wtf, the sales manager just shrugs his shoulders and goes \"it was under priced, this is the new price want it or not?\" \n\nI told him to get fucked for wasting my time driving there and not even mentioning the price had changed and he suddenly tried to make me a \"deal\" at 40k. I ended up going home and just bought a brand new one instead. Interest rates at the time on a used vehicle only made sense in the 35k range vs 0% on a brand new vehicle anyways. \n\nI reported this to AMVIC and they basically said it didn't violate any regulations and unless I actually bought the vehicle, there was nothing they could do to even investigate.

I've raided ours for dental (thousands, a few years back) and have thousands in their now as well.\n\nOf course it's each to their own, and absolutely correct that if people can't stick to putting that money aside and leaving there, it ain't gonna work.
