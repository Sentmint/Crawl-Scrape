(NASDAQ: ENPH), a global energy technology company and the world\u2019s leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, announced today financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022, which included the summary below from its President and CEO, Badri Kothandaraman.\n\nWe reported record quarterly revenue of $724.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, along with 43.8% for non-GAAP gross margin. We shipped 4,873,702 microinverters, or approximately 1,952.4 megawatts DC, and 122.1 megawatt hours of Enphase\u00ae IQ\u2122 Batteries.\n\nFinancial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2022 are listed below:\n\nRecord quarterly revenue of $724.7 million\n\nGAAP gross margin of 42.9%; non-GAAP gross margin of 43.8%\n\nGAAP operating income of $157.0 million; non-GAAP operating income of $229.4 million\n\nGAAP net income of $153.8 million; non-GAAP net income of $212.4 million\n\nGAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.06; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.51\n\nFree cash flow of $237.3 million; ending cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $1.61 billion\n\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased 14%, compared to the third quarter of 2022, driven by strong demand for Enphase Energy Systems\u2122. Our revenue in the United States for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased approximately 15% and our revenue in Europe increased approximately 21%, compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 43.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 42.9% in the third quarter of 2022, driven by IQ8\u2122 Microinverter product mix.\n\nOur non-GAAP operating expenses were $87.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $78.6 million in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to investment in international growth, customer service, and R&D. Our non-GAAP operating income was $229.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $194.0 million in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nWe exited the fourth quarter of 2022 with $1.61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and generated $253.7 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our capital expenditures were $16.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $8.9 million in the third quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily due to investment in additional contract manufacturing sites and R&D equipment.\n\nIQ8 Microinverters constituted approximately 55% of all our microinverter shipments during the fourth quarter of 2022. We introduced IQ8 Microinverters in France and the Netherlands in the fourth quarter of 2022, marking the first expansion into international markets for the product since its successful launch in North America in late 2021.\n\nOur IQ Battery shipments were 122.1 megawatt hours in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to 133.6 megawatt hours in the third quarter of 2022. We made significant software upgrades to continue improving the installer and homeowner experience and brought commissioning times down. We shipped IQ Batteries to North America, Germany, and Belgium during the fourth quarter of 2022. We now have approximately 2,300 installers worldwide that are certified to install our IQ Batteries.\n\nWe are adding additional manufacturing capacity in the United States due to the strong global demand for our products as well as the incentives related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We plan to begin domestic manufacturing in the second quarter of 2023 with a new contract manufacturing partner and in the second half of 2023 with our two existing contract manufacturing partners.\n\nWe began manufacturing Enphase-branded electric vehicle (EV) chargers at our contract manufacturing facility in Mexico, helping us to increase capacity and reduce costs. We expect to introduce IQ smart EV chargers to customers in the United States in the first half of 2023. They will provide connectivity and control, enabling use cases like green charging and allowing homeowners visibility into the operation of their Enphase solar-plus-storage-plus-EV system through the Enphase\u00ae App.\n\nWe continued to make progress on our installer platform. We made updates to Solargraf\u2120 software during the fourth quarter of 2022, incorporating battery design and proposal, document management, consumption modeling, and several other improvements requested by our installer partners. In addition, we made significant strides in automating the creation of permit plan sets with Solargraf software. We now have more than 1,000 installers using the software.\n\nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enphase-energy-reports-financial-results-210500599.html", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10wdmii/enphase_energy_reports_financial_results_for_the/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wdmii/enphase_energy_reports_financial_results_for_the/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10wdmii", "author": "t2_7qc9z5ho", "commentCount": 16, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_407mq", "body": "They are a beast and will continue to grow.", "created_utc": 1675805592.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7mhg7h", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wdmii/enphase_energy_reports_financial_results_for_the/j7mhg7h/", "score": 19, "ups": 19}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_2k4j1q96", "body": "Up 10% AH.

Higher-level managers are sharing the directive with their subordinates in the coming weeks, separate from the company\u2019s regular performance reviews that are currently underway, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a matter that wasn\u2019t public. Individual contributors aren\u2019t in charge of others, and instead focus on tasks like coding, designing and research.\n> \n> Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, **fired 13% of its workforce in November** during its first major layoff. In the months since, staff have faced intense anxiety about the potential for future cuts, the people said. Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg explained during the company\u2019s earnings report this month that he still felt the organization was too slow-moving and bloated. He called 2023 the \u201cYear of Efficiency\u201d and vowed to cut middle-managers and underperforming projects. \n> \n> The *current round of job cuts will be more gradual, enacted on an individual basis*, the people said.  Some Meta employees said they felt the change was needed given the organization includes some teams that compete to achieve similar goals and managers that oversee only one or two employees, the people said. Meta declined to comment.\n> \n> Zuckerberg\u2019s plan for a leaner organization helped the share price recover from 2022, which was its worst year ever. It\u2019s **up more than 56% so far this year**. \n\nCriticism of Meta's efficiency is not new. [Here is John Carmack](https://www.businessinsider.com/former-meta-oculus-vr-executive-john-carmack-criticizes-spending-2023-2), the \"consulting CTO for the company's virtual reality efforts in 2019 after Meta acquired Oculus in 2014. He had previously been Oculus' CTO. Carmack left Meta in 2022 and has since turned his focus to artificial intelligence through his startup Keen Technologies.\"\n\n> \"I was having some real issues at Meta with large-scale strategic directions,\" Carmack said in an interview with the business publication, Dallas Innovates. \"I'm sure you've seen some of the headlines about how much money they're spending, and I thought large fractions were really poorly spent.\" [...]\n\n> \"I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it,\" Carmack said in the memo.\n> \n> Carmack also said at the time that the company has \"a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.\"\n> \n> \"There is no way to sugar coat this; I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy,\" he said.\n\nZuckerberg is turning much more responsive to shareholders at this point than his peers after all the share price destruction.

UBS analysts said last week that it\u2019s on track to reach 100 million monthly active users more quickly than video-sharing app TikTok.\n\nMicrosoft is seeking to capitalize on the attention in multiple ways. The company provides the cloud-computing back end for ChatGPT, and in January Microsoft said it had invested billions of dollars in OpenAI. Microsoft has also been working to incorporate OpenAI technologies into its own products. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it is augmenting Bing, its search engine, and Edge, its internet browser, with ChatGPT-like technology.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft plans to announce technology for companies, schools and governments to create their own bots with ChatGPT, according to a person briefed on the matter, who asked not to be named while discussing private plans. Microsoft imagines helping clients launch new chatbots or refine their existing ones with the new technology, which could suggest responses for call-center agents to use during customer service conversations, the person said.\n\nThe underlying artificial-intelligence model of ChatGPT cannot currently provide substantial answers about anything that happened after 2021, because it hasn\u2019t been trained on recent information. But Microsoft intends for chatbots launched with its business ChatGPT service to contain up-to-date information, the person said.\n\nThe service should also provide citations to specific resources, the person said, just as the new Bing and Edge will do. (The current public version of ChatGPT does not cite sources.)\n\nChatGPT has not been cheap for OpenAI to operate. Each chat probably costs \u201csingle-digit cents,\u201d Altman said in a December tweet, suggesting that serving chats to 100 million people a month could cost millions of dollars. Like other cloud infrastructure providers, Microsoft is mindful of customer spending and likely doesn\u2019t want the service to end up costing clients great sums more than they had imagined. To that end, Microsoft plans to give customers tools to estimate and limit spending, the person said.\n\nMicrosoft has also discussed letting enterprise customers display a customized message before interacting with their chatbots, similar to how the new Bing will display a welcome screen indicating it can respond to complex questions and provide information.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft wants to give customers ways to upload their own data and refine the voice of their chatbots, and it intends to let customers replace Microsoft and OpenAI branding, the person said.\n\nMicrosoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, arch-rival Google is moving forward with similar plans using its own technology. On Monday, Google parent Alphabet announced an artificial-intelligence chatbot named Bard, and CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in an internal email that it will soon enlist developers and enterprises to test an API that lets them access the underlying LaMDA technology.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10wfbwk/microsoft_will_make_chatgpt_tech_available_for/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wfbwk/microsoft_will_make_chatgpt_tech_available_for/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10wfbwk", "author": "t2_mc7q2", "commentCount": 5, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_61t7q4n3", "body": ">The service should also provide citations to specific resources, the person said, just as the new Bing and Edge will do.

Google will open up the conversation technology to \u201ctrusted testers\u201d ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.\n\nLast week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a \u201ccode red\u201d plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called \u201cApprentice Bard,\u201d as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.\n\n\u201cSoon, you\u2019ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that\u2019s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,\u201d wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.\n\nThe product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company\u2019s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.\n\nCNBC reported that Google\u2019s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more \u201creputational risk\u201d in providing wrong information and thus is moving \u201cmore conservatively than a small startup.\u201d However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.\n\nGoogle\u2019s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.\n\nThe company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying \u201cwe\u2019ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard\u2019s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.\u201d", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10vikbb/google_announces_bard_ai_in_response_to_chatgpt/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10vikbb", "author": "t2_mc7q2", "commentCount": 482, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_7ikvcj9", "body": "Maybe we will have front row seats for the A.I. civil war?

These factors are even worse when you consider a few other things: \n\n* It's been stated that each ChatGPT query consumes significantly more resources then a single search engine query (I've seen articles stating that it's as much 60 times the average search query), meaning it's much more expensive to run then a search engine. Odds are very good that anything Google creates will have this problem as well.\n\n* There seem to be much more limited ways of monetizing this technology. Google Search can sell ads to appear at the top of the search results for certain queries, but ChatGPT type products can't really do that so well. And for as long as the market remains competitive the players are going to be especially limited in how many ads they can try to stuff into these AI's. Because if people feel that Bard or ChatGPT are just constantly shilling advertiser's products then they'll go elsewhere.\n\nBottom line, regardless of who wins in this AI battle, it DOESN'T mean that the winner will be a good investment.

Please read my post more carefully before jumping to wrong conclusions.\n\nGoogle is undeniably a leader and pioneer in the AI space.

Now you can argue that it was because their product managers could not make a sufficiently compelling business case to operationalize any of these \"AI as a service\" services, or the reason was something else or whatever.\n\nThat doesn't change the facts themselves. Which is that Google has not operationalized any AI As A Service that is highly visible to consumers and has the kind of mindshare as ChatGpt. You can make excuses like \"they wanted to verify the accuracy\" or \"they wanted to protect their reputation\" etc but those are just excuses. There are standard ways to caveat this kind of stuff - companies would normally call them experimental features or Alpha/Beta features or Google Labs features. And Jesus Christ, they've had a decade to figure this out!\n\nLike i said, i honestly think the blunt truth is that Google makes such a boatload of money from ad sales, it has probably become super difficult for them to see commercial value in any of this stuff as it doesn't give them the same shovel loads of cash right away or even in the near future.

It's a highly valuable resource for the energy sector; the continual transition from fossil fuel to clean energy sources, such as nuclear fuel, has boosted the demand for uranium and its related products.**\n\nFor investors, this is an opportunity to capitalize on emerging trends and make some profits in the process. In this article, we will look at the best uranium companies to invest in for 2023. We'll discuss how you can identify a good stock, where you can find reliable information about uranium stocks, and which ones may be worth investing in over the next few years.\n\nUranium Royalty Corp. (NASDAQ:UROY)\n\nAs the only uranium-focused royalty in the world, Uranium Royalty Corp. strategically acquires royalty interests in uranium projects. It has an impressive portfolio of assets and is well-positioned to benefit from the industry's long-term prospects.\n\nWhile UROY stock prices saw an average 1Y drop at -22.75%, the company's value is on the way up after announcing a new connection with the McArthur River mine. The plan is to receive royalty proceeds from the mine's physical uranium delivery; 15M lbs of U308 per year will be produced from 2024 onward.\n\nIf this plan reaches fruition, shareholders stand to benefit considerably. The UROY stock price has been fluctuating in early 2023, but showing a general upward trajectory.\n\n### BHP (BHP)\n\nAustralia's Olympic Dam mine is known to be one of the largest uranium deposits worldwide. It's owned by BHP, a global leader in the exploration, development, and production of minerals. Uranium deposits from the dam in 2022 equaled 2.4 million metric tons.\n\nThe company is heavily invested in uranium exploration, both through its operations and investments in various projects across Australia and Canada. BHP has a robust balance sheet and a market cap of US$166.74 billion.\n\nBHP remains a highly viable stock option for investors thanks to the company's proactive resource profile expansion. It continually explores new opportunities in uranium as well as silver, gold, and copper, among other assets.\n\n### Cameco Corporation (CCJ)\n\nSpeaking of the McArthur River mine, there's another company with stakes in this uranium deposit \u2013 Cameco. The company also owns a 50% stake in Cigar Lake, Saskatchewan. As the world's largest uranium producer on the public market, Cameco has the potential for long-term growth.\n\nCameco has a market cap of US$10.99 billion and is expanding its reach rapidly; in November 2022, the company made a deal with one of the largest Chinese nuclear power operators, China National Nuclear Corporation.\n\nCameco Corporation reportedly recorded 45 million pounds worth of long-term uranium contracts last year, with plans to increase that number moving forward.\n\n### Energy Fuels Inc. (UUUU)\n\nIn December 2022, Energy Fuels was awarded a strategic contract for US$18.5 million in uranium concentrates. This, combined with the company's ownership of Nichols Ranch ISR and Alta Mesa ISR projects, highlights Energy Fuels Inc as a potentially strong stock option for investors.\n\nEnergy Fuels is the largest U.S.-based producer of uranium and vanadium (a rare earth metal). It has two facilities in Utah and Colorado, with a total licensed capacity to produce up to 8 million pounds of U3O8 annually.\n\nThe company's stock price saw an average 1Y rise at 30.44%, as well as a 20.03% YTD. With its strategic contracts and value to nuclear power producers, Energy Fuels Inc remains one of the strongest companies in the industry right now.\n\n### Uranium Energy Corp. (UEC)\n\nUranium Energy Corp is a U.S.-based company that operates various uranium mining projects across six U.S. states. Its world-class Hobson Central Processing Plant has been approved for an expanded radioactive material license; moving forward, UEC aims to produce 4 million pounds of U3O8 per year.\n\nUEC stock prices have seen a 63.22% rise in the past year with a 1.68% YTD. Analysts forecast a high price of $8.25 and a median price of $6.80 over the next 12 months.\n\n## Uranium ETFs\n\nInvestors may also consider investing in uranium-focused ETFs, such as the Global X Uranium ETF (URA) or Sprott Uranium Miners. ETFs are a great way to diversify your portfolio and access a wide range of uranium stocks in one simple bundle.\n\n## Best Uranium Stocks Conclusion\n\nWhile no stock can be guaranteed to perform, uranium has become an increasingly popular sector for investors in recent years thanks to its demand. Uranium fuels nuclear power, which is a highly valuable resource to the energy sector.\n\nThe stocks mentioned above are some of the best uranium stocks to buy right now, but investors should always do their own research before investing. It's also worth keeping an eye on ETFs like URA and Sprott Uranium Miners if you're looking for a more diversified portfolio in this sector.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10w9ovj", "author": "t2_jcv0h", "commentCount": 7, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_c6poniml", "body": "GLOBAL ATOMIC.", "created_utc": 1675810058.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7msp66", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7msp66/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_12jbxe", "body": "Thanks for this", "created_utc": 1675807485.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7mmce0", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7mmce0/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_40kdjkli", "body": "Hardly any of bhp\u2019s revenue comes from uranium.", "created_utc": 1675816866.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7n8n8m", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7n8n8m/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_v2iycs07", "body": "What about $CCJ ?", "created_utc": 1675815026.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7n4fom", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7n4fom/", "score": 0, "ups": 0}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_zg665sz", "body": "Dilution ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)", "created_utc": 1675816974.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7n8vyl", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7n8vyl/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_q88k1", "body": "bruh", "created_utc": 1675826439.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7nttit", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10w9ovj/best_uranium_stocks_to_buy_now_2023/j7nttit/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}]}, {"id": "10wii4g", "title": "Portfolio critique", "flair": null, "subreddit": "r/stocks", "created_utc": 1675817207.0, "upvote": 4, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "selfText": "Background first: I am a 20m college student with \\~1000 in a roth and \\~6500 in taxable (mostly from gifts).

I'm old enough to (barely) remember the dot com bubble and when the S&P 500 went flat from 2000-2012 so I've seen the downside risk of large growth stocks. \n\n- RWL is another good choice.

Stock options are basically expected by any good executive that you would want to hire, and keeping the best talent means you'll need to pay them in stock options as well. This is not really easily done for private companies like it is for public companies, and private companies have to give a higher dollar value of shares for the same talent than public companies because of the liquidity premium demanded by their employees. And finally, if the stable companies want to raise capital in the future for an expansion, pivot into a new industry (oil companies pivoting into green energy for example), or convert debt into equity to save on interest payments, all of that is much cheaper and easier to do if you are a public company than if you are a private company. Why close off that option for no benefit to the owners?\n\nAs a final not-insignificant benefit: If a company's founder or people who got in on the ground floor want to get out of the company and go actually retire, it is easier to do if it is a public company than a private company.
