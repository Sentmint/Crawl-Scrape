The Fed will raise rates just to drop them again.\n\nAs of right now QT is still in effect which is sucking cash out of the banking system while rates hikes are starting to slow. Investors are taking the dovishness in the last hike as positive, but this only affects overnight lending within the banking system.

And no, they mean the opposite, this time is NOT different.  But us, waifs of Wall Street, cannot be faulted for having no knowledge of the past.  Anything not found in CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, etc., is not verifiable history.   And, are hearsay.  When Burry said \"SELL\", it probably irritated JP who reserves that call to himself, so he turned dovish to spite the Big Short.  But this spat between Mr. Long and Big Short is creating a cloud of dust for the rest of us.\n\nObjectively speaking, whatever JP says, the conditions of the economy, with an astronomic federal debt of 31 Trillion dollars, an inflation rate that is ready to rise from its current 6% if interest rate hikes are capped by rising business closures and labor layoffs, really do not have a straight-forward analytic solution as to what the fed funds rate should rise to, how fast, and how long.\n\nAny statement from JP or others, including Burry, are really just conjectures.  But when their conjectures can influence market buy or sell decisions, they assume the color of Poker-like bets.  When such a player cannot see a likely win, he can still win by bluffing and forcing others to give up before he does.  Such a strategy works if nobody can count the cards accurately enough to reveal the actual odds of any player's chances of winning.  But there are those who can, through their access to critical data that others don't have.  Burry reaches to the past to justify his a priori probabilities.  But there are current data that he may not have access to.  Such as when he wrote \"Sell!\" and the market went up instead when JP turned dovish 6 days ago, on 2/1/23.  Now, JP is doubling down on his dovish stance.  Not based on the data when the super-high non-farm payroll reported on 2/3/23 was more than double what was expected.  Doubling-down in the face of deteriorating data is a red flag.  It doubles the chance that the roller may have a poor hand, and needs to rely on bluffing.  Once this is started, the player may have no choice but to keep doubling down, until he has bet his whole capital, which nobody is asking or wanting him to do.  But the logic of his play demands that he does, because the drawdown would otherwise be irremediable.  Reminds one of Nick Leeson playing the Nikkei futures on behalf of the Baring Brothers Bank.  Now, I wish JP is right and Burry is wrong.  But when even Larry Summers repeatedly warns against a premature tapering of interest rate hikes, suggesting a Will E. Coyote scenario in the end, what is important is not what we believe, but what the data is saying.", "created_utc": 1675813592.0, "edited": 1675814028.0, "id": "j7n148b", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10w9b7q/michael_burry_twitter_post_explain_it_to_me_like/j7n148b/", "score": 6, "ups": 6}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_15c5vm", "body": "Line go down, bad.\nLine go up, good.", "created_utc": 1675801741.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7m7asj", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10w9b7q/michael_burry_twitter_post_explain_it_to_me_like/j7m7asj/", "score": 5, "ups": 5}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_11lfp1", "body": "Unga bunga sell off crash crash crash, now different believe me", "created_utc": 1675800732.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7m4o3e", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10w9b7q/michael_burry_twitter_post_explain_it_to_me_like/j7m4o3e/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_4l1ijidp", "body": "This dude is so annoying", "created_utc": 1675810711.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7muaki", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10w9b7q/michael_burry_twitter_post_explain_it_to_me_like/j7muaki/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_6xp6yewb", "body": "No blue check?

Bloomberg also reported that Apple was planning to roll out a mixed-reality headset, likely in June at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The headset will reportedly cost up to $3,000, though the company is also working on a cheaper version of it.\n\nThough Apple made some job cuts in its retail division and CEO Tim Cook took a pay cut, it was notable that the iPhone maker is now the only big tech company that has not announced major layoffs. There is little expectation that it will do so as the company did not ramp up hiring during the pandemic, unlike many of its big tech peers. That puts it in a better position than its rivals.\n\nNow what\n\nApple reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Feb. 2, and while the results were underwhelming, Apple stock actually rose on the news as Cook touted accomplishments like its installed base topping 2 billion devices; Cook also noted that production headwinds dented sales.\n\nRevenue in the quarter fell 5.5% to $117.1 billion, missing estimates of $121.1 billion, and earnings per share also slipped from $2.10 to $1.88, which was below the analyst consensus of $1.94. On a constant-currency basis, sales growth was flat.\n\nDespite expectations that those headwinds will continue into the second quarter, the company said that production has returned to normal levels and that it's done a lot of work to improve gross margins, which have benefited from the growth of the services segment.\n\nConsidering its abundant competitive advantages and price-to-earnings ratio near that of the S&P 500, the stock looks well priced currently even if growth is expected to be weak this year.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/10wjwmz/apple_stock_gained_11_in_january/", "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10wjwmz/apple_stock_gained_11_in_january/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10wjwmz", "author": "t2_veiy60xr", "commentCount": 0, "comments": []}, {"id": "10w8jgj", "title": "Zoom Video to Cut 1,300 Jobs, or 15% of Global Workforce", "flair": "News", "subreddit": "r/StockMarket", "created_utc": 1675793096.0, "upvote": 13, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "selfText": "", "selfUrl": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-07/zoom-to-cut-1-300-jobs-as-ceo-yuan-reduces-pay-forfeits-bonus", "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/10w8jgj/zoom_video_to_cut_1300_jobs_or_15_of_global/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10w8jgj", "author": "t2_xpdjg", "commentCount": 1, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_41x6kgvt", "body": "Yuan's  base pay was 300K so now -20% less.

Investing in ChatGPT's competitor, the startup Anthropic, is only the first step, and Google's own chatbot Bard, based on the large language model LaMDA, is the key to victory.\n\nAs a pioneer in AI technology, Google is undoubtedly the best in the business, and Bard can leverage Google's vast information base to provide accurate and high-quality answers to users, posing a strong threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36xh5sfmlrga1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7293b6ed2b2dca41fc6d4a60282e34a6efb0c67b\n\nIn the face of its rivals, Google has invested about $300 million in AI startup Anthropic, taking a 10% stake in the company, which will use the investment to buy a large amount of computing resources from Google's cloud computing division.\n\nAnd Google has already started to speed up its research and development in this AI \u201cwar\u201d. According to media reports, Google executives have recently accelerated the review and release of AI projects, while also assigning teams of engineers to embark on new R&D projects to integrate new results into areas such as core search.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xd0azkynlrga1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=488bfc60f2089a4f36aa2ffce7a23bc72baf86d7\n\nOn Monday, CEO Sundar Pichai announced in a blog post that in 2021, Google began development of conversational AI services powered by the Language Model for Conversational Applications (LaMDA), and today, LaMDA-powered Bard will be available to trusted testers and ready to be made available \"in the coming weeks \"to be made available to the public on a larger scale.\n\nAlso in the blog post, he revealed that next month, in March this year, Google's Generative Language Application Port (API) will be opened to businesses, developers and creators, allowing developers to build their own apps using Google's language model.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i694vp1qlrga1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4c03c8b5fed6275dc85592c8bc845518d3356d6\n\nThis is also the latest decision made by Google under pressure from investors.\n\nMicrosoft, which is already one step ahead, had previously announced that it would hold an event this Tuesday to announce \"progress on a number of exciting projects,\" which was expected to include a version of Bing that would include chatbots.\n\nThe move once sparked discontent among Google investors, who felt that the company was not moving quickly enough to release internal AI tools compared to its rivals. As the technology pioneer of tools like ChatGPT, Google also did not play to its strengths, which even sparked dissatisfaction among the company's internal researchers.\n\nBut in response to previous questions about the progress of development, Google executives said that the pace of developing its own chatbot was not slow and took a very cautious approach to the process. They believe this is in some contrast to competitor ChatGPT, which makes up information based on the content of users' queries.\n\nExecutives also stressed that they must test the new tools as a way to ensure they provide objective information and avoid information abuse.\n\nWith pioneering AI technologies, Google's technological leadership is undeniable.\n\nLaMDA, developed by Google, is a large language model based on billions of words trained on the web. Not only does it benefit from Google's greater computing power and R&D team, but Google also has the ability to fine-tune the LaMDA model and the chatbot Bard with feedback from millions of users. According to Pichai, Bard can leverage Google's vast information base to provide users with accurate and high-quality answers, posing a strong threat to Microsoft and ChatGPT.\n\nAnd even more amazingly, a Google engineer who has interacted with LaMDA even thinks it \"has human perception. In June last year, Google AI ethics researcher Blake Lemoine published a 21-page investigation report and submitted it to the company, trying to get senior management to recognize the \"personality\" of LaMDA.

As a result, a lot of people and companies have been able to invest a lot while taking on a lot of debt. It's not exactly like what happened in 1929 but high debt and loose investing isn't a good thing. \n\nThat has, however, led to the stock value of many companies to be over inflated, much as with tech stocks in the late 90's. \n\nWe have high inflation that is driving the value of everything down and slowing down spending, much as in the 70's. \n\nThere has been a resurgence of lending with lil attention paid to people with bad credit, mainly targeting minority communities for home loans and anyone looking for a car loan. This is similar to what we saw in '08 with a lot more over investment in real estate by hedge funds and investment groups to the point they were buying up entire subdivisions. \n\nWith the high inflation and seizing of Russian assets, we have also seen some countries advocating getting away from using the dollar. \n\nSo, what can we expect? Value of the dollar going down. Costs of everything going up. Availability of commodities going down. This will make it more costly for businesses at every level to survive. The first place businesses cut cost is typically payroll, so higher unemployment. Less people working means less people spending so everyone will be cutting their spending. \n\nLess money goes back to the companies so they will tighten their belts more. A lot of businesses will close shop. Some will get bought out or chopped up. \n\nWith costs going up and value of money going down, it's going to be harder to get loans and credit. This will make getting houses, cars, and loans of any type more difficult. It'll make it harder to get loans to start a job and companies are going to hire less. Less employment, chances are you will see more crime. With all the events of the last several years, you'll see a sharp increase of violent crime. \n\nWe could see a lot of financial instability overseas and supply chain issues that make the last few years look like a cake walk. In your typical third world country, you'll see foreign investment drop so less money and less jobs. So increases in crime, violence, insurgencies, and wars. Less food and water, when water is already a big concern for a lot of people. \n\nAlso, in such times, the typical response from some leaders has been to use it as an excuse to go to war. With other geo-political issues already in play we will probably see China try for Taiwan, Turkey going into Syria, Ethiopia and Egypt fight over water, and all sorts of God-knows what fun in the Balkans and the Middle East. That will all drive up the cost of oil and gas.\n\nOver all, we will at least, on the hopeful side, get a recession. It will bring down inflation, people will save money more, and we can get some stocks on sale. But the dominoes are set up for it to be really bad. Everything I said plus who know what will happen with the Chinese economy and politics with how shakey that has been lately. But if it is bad, we can get through it in the end and hopefully make it better after. After all, cant make s'mores without a fire. \n\nBut Im just a guy on the internet.
