He called 2023 the \u201cYear of Efficiency\u201d and vowed to cut middle-managers and underperforming projects. \n> \n> The *current round of job cuts will be more gradual, enacted on an individual basis*, the people said.  Some Meta employees said they felt the change was needed given the organization includes some teams that compete to achieve similar goals and managers that oversee only one or two employees, the people said.

I still do think that will be tricky in practice because orgs with proper leaders would\u2019ve typically already identified and addressed such problems, without input from above; but it\u2019s possible this is the right move for some companies, Meta included.\n\nOriginal answer:\nAs someone working in FAANG (or whatever we call it these days) I disagree with you. I understand where you\u2019re coming from and I\u2019d probably say the same 10 years ago. \n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019m not at Meta and I\u2019m totally capable of switching to IC and be successful but this is not where I add the most value and my teams recognize it. I spend most of my days doing work that my teams aren\u2019t as effective at: aligning external stakeholders, making sure we actually do make decisions instead of being stuck in analysis paralysis, coaching my teams so that they can do that themselves. \n\nIn a way, my job is to manage myself out of the job. But most importantly, I own the outcomes. I\u2019m the one accountable: when my org succeeds - it\u2019s their success. When they fail - that\u2019s on me. My strength is ability to speak my teams\u2019 language, my leadership\u2019 language, as well as product and every other partner and stakeholder. \n\nSome time ago Google released a study called project oxygen, explaining which manager\u2019s qualities make or break teams.

Bond can predict a recession by inverting the 2 yr/10 yr, but stocks can still rally because a recession hasn't happened yet, and the lower 10 year yield boosts stock valuation. That's actually what's happening right now. Powell can only do so much to influence the 10 year rate. The Fed controls the 2 year, not 10 year.\n\nThe nominal yields are falling, due to the inflation expectation falling. The REAL yield is not falling that much. Fed cares about the REAL yield. What Powell really cares about, is to maintain about 1.5% REAL yield across all short and medium time span.\n\nHow the Fed defines financial conditions is different from how WE define it. The Fed is concerned about financial conditions associated with interest rate. OUR financial conditions include a bunch of extra stuff like stock prices (which is affected more by corporate profits), spreads (which is heavily influenced by risk premiums), currency (influenced by what other countries do), etc.\n\nYou seem to be implying the Fed doesn't care about data, which is flat out wrong. What data is the Fed ignoring? The Fed is dissecting components within the inflation numbers, looking forward 6-9 months out, not backward looking data. Just because you have a 0.3% core PCE MoM data doesn't mean we're out of the woods. Powell said in the last FOMC that the deflation/disinflationary components like commodities, energy, durable goods are all transitory and WILL revert their trends by middle of 2023. Without those deflation/disinflation contributions, we can easily go back to around 4% annualized (not annual) core PCE. As for the job market, the wage inflation is still 1-1.5% above what's consistent with 2% inflation. Outside of wage inflation, every other job number indicate the job market is still extremely tight.\n\nSo exactly what data is the Fed ignoring? Which part of their guidance don't you agree with? The bears have been wrong because SP500 went up to 4150 in 2 months? Did you completely ignore the period when SP500 went up to 4320 from 3650, just to drop back to 3500? By the way, a lot of the bearish strategists told people to buy Sp500 in Oct at around 3600 and predicted a year end rally up to around 4100.\n\nPrecisely, all the bearish strategists who are predicting a recession in the second half of 2023, revised their 2022 sp500 target to 4000 around Sept 2022.

Robinhood makes money in a number of ways, notably through a system known as payment for order flow. That is, Robinhood routes its users' orders through a market maker who actually makes the trades and compensates Robinhood for the business at a rate of a fraction of a cent per share.\n\nMost mainstream trading companies do not have commissions, they take a very small part of the spread as \u201ccommission\u201d but its next to nothing. \n\nThings have changed since there were trading commissions of $5-$10 per trade. The entire point of why Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Webull, etc. changed it to the no commission structure is because they were marketing to the people who only have a small amount of money and are looking to learn trading. \n\nI don\u2019t think people care about ads if they get to have unlimited day trades, I sure wouldn\u2019t. Plus, people would just use an adblocker if it was really that bothersome, although I don\u2019t think that the companies most people would be using (TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Robinhood, Webull) would do that because the entire point of them moving away from commission based trading was to attract people who had a small amount of capital. \n\n>PDT rule makes sure that if you are taking a lot of risk, at least you have the funds to back it up. \n\nThat\u2019s fundamentally false. If there was tule in place that did away with having a margin account any larger than 1:1, then borrowing anymore than you put in would be completely banned and the problem would be solved. It\u2019s simple, people who have a margin account put in, say, $100 and they cannot borrow any of the broker\u2019s money, they can only use the money they\u2019ve put in and day trade with unlimited day trades with it.

It doesn\u2019t even really make sense because if traders weren\u2019t taking 20 or 30 or 40 day trades a day (which it doesn\u2019t sound like they were) then I don\u2019t see the initial problem. The problem was that a bunch of people who had poor risk management skills borrowed a lot of money on margin and then the bubble popped and people lost a lot of money on it. People seemed to just be putting a bunch of money in and holding overnight it sounds like, which is swing trading and not day trading. \n\nA simple change in rules could have been, \u201cyou can only day trade with the amount of money you have in your account and cannot trade on margin until you have $25K in your account.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s still really nothing stopping someone from taking their weekly paycheck and putting it into 0DTE options contracts, losing all their money not understanding the risk fully or thinking they\u2019ll strike it big and doing the same thing the next week on payday.\n\nPeople who are reckless with their money will be reckless with their money no matter what. The problem still exists and was not actually solved. The problem that needs to be solved is short term instant gratification and competency in risk management. \n\nNot only that, but more and more states are legalizing online sports betting and there is no guardrails from someone taking their entire paycheck.\n\nWhat is the difference between holding a stock for 50 seconds and 50 years? Not really as much as you\u2019d think. You might counter argue, \u201cWell, the market has historically gone up over time\u201d but you know as well as I that while that is true, the number one rule in investing is, \u201cpast performance does not equal future return.\u201d \n\nNot only that, but anyone can open an account with a FOREX broker, put their entire paycheck in and lose it all and FOREX doesn\u2019t have a pattern day trading rule. Other countries don\u2019t have pattern day trading rules for stock trading either. \n\nAlso, absolutely nothing is stopping someone from taking their entire paycheck and day trading or swing trading penny stocks. If someone\u2019s payday was yesterday and they put their entire paycheck into HOLO at market open today and then dropped by about 20% about 45 minutes later and then hoping it would go back up by market close and then proceeded to drop another 20% before the person decided to sell their position at market close, they would have lost 40%. \n\nSo you see, the pattern day trading rule did not stop people who have problems with instant gratification from being reckless with their paycheck. At the end of the day people who want to \u201cget rich quick\u201d will try to find a way to do so no matter what. The initial problem that the pattern day trading rule was trying to solve could have been solved by not allowing people to borrow on margin and that\u2019s it. If people are serious about making sure people are informed before day trading with unlimited day trades, though, then there should be a test administered by the SEC that tests the basics of stock trading and also risk management principles instead of having an arbitrary amount of $25k as a barrier to entry for unlimited trades.

Which would literally be what margin does. You're just describing a margin account with extra steps. Margin isn't just about extending your buying power. They're also covering funds that haven't been settled yet. That could represent a pretty large risk to the broker, which is why they don't allow that. It's less about protecting you and more about making sure you don't fuck them over. \n\n  I agree with you in that the 25k rule is kind of pointless. 1000 people could sign up tomorrow and blow up their account in a single trade on options. If anything, the rules need to be more clearly defined. I DON'T agree that you should be able to make infinite day trades, however. A person that can't make money within the allotted amount of trades in a cash account based on settlement has no business making infinite day trades. Having the patience and the skill to make it work with a small account and limited trades is a fundamental learning process toward being a profitable day trader. \n\n  But with that being said, there are still ways around it anyway. There are plenty of offshore brokers that will allow margin with smaller accounts in exchange for a higher commission fee. If someone truly wants to go that route, it's more than possible to get around the PDT rule and the 25k capital requirements in order to day trade. It really just comes down to knowledge and skill. If someone isn't willing to put in the time to research all of these things in order to be successful, should they even be allowed to make infinite trades in the first place? Or better yet, would YOU want to be the person that foots the bill for some random dude thinking he's hot shit making 10 trades in a single day with funds that haven't even been settled yet?
