One such example is the stock buybacks, which were once considered illegal but have now become commonplace.\nIn 1982, the SEC, under the leadership of John Shad, a former Wall Street executive, initiated Rule 10-b-18, effectively repealing the prohibition on stock buybacks. The result? Stock buybacks have become an increasingly corrupt way for corporate leaders to enrich themselves, with record amounts of $1.26 trillion recorded last year.\n\nNow, President Biden proposed a 4% surcharge on stock buybacks in his State of the Union Address, which received little attention when it was included in the Inflation Reduction Act in August. Although the 1% tax raised about $78 billion over the next decade, quadrupling it to 4% could raise $185 billion, according to the Tax Foundation.\nSo, why would Republicans be foolish not to support the increase in stock buyback tax? There's no way to argue that increasing this tax would reduce job creation, as stock buybacks reduce job creation by siphoning away capital.\n\nQ: How do you think increasing the stock buyback tax will affect American capitalism and its stakeholders in the long run?

The recession will create layoffs and unemployment. In his view, that triggers a reduction of the Fed rate, and he said the government will want to inject stimulus money into the economy. So he suggests there would temporary deflation. As a result of the recession and deflation, the Fed will raise rates again, which spikes CPI higher again, and that creates another recession. This second recession would be while the unemployment rate is much higher. And that would tank the market much more than the first recession. If that is the theory, then the first recession would occur by the end of 2023. Then 2024 is the rebound where the government adds stimulus money, and the Fed cuts rates.

And no, they mean the opposite, this time is NOT different.  But us, waifs of Wall Street, cannot be faulted for having no knowledge of the past.  Anything not found in CNN, CNBC, MSNBC, etc., is not verifiable history.   And, are hearsay.  When Burry said \"SELL\", it probably irritated JP who reserves that call to himself, so he turned dovish to spite the Big Short.  But this spat between Mr. Long and Big Short is creating a cloud of dust for the rest of us.\n\nObjectively speaking, whatever JP says, the conditions of the economy, with an astronomic federal debt of 31 Trillion dollars, an inflation rate that is ready to rise from its current 6% if interest rate hikes are capped by rising business closures and labor layoffs, really do not have a straight-forward analytic solution as to what the fed funds rate should rise to, how fast, and how long.\n\nAny statement from JP or others, including Burry, are really just conjectures.  But when their conjectures can influence market buy or sell decisions, they assume the color of Poker-like bets.  When such a player cannot see a likely win, he can still win by bluffing and forcing others to give up before he does.  Such a strategy works if nobody can count the cards accurately enough to reveal the actual odds of any player's chances of winning.  But there are those who can, through their access to critical data that others don't have.  Burry reaches to the past to justify his a priori probabilities.  But there are current data that he may not have access to.  Such as when he wrote \"Sell!\" and the market went up instead when JP turned dovish 6 days ago, on 2/1/23.  Now, JP is doubling down on his dovish stance.  Not based on the data when the super-high non-farm payroll reported on 2/3/23 was more than double what was expected.  Doubling-down in the face of deteriorating data is a red flag.  It doubles the chance that the roller may have a poor hand, and needs to rely on bluffing.  Once this is started, the player may have no choice but to keep doubling down, until he has bet his whole capital, which nobody is asking or wanting him to do.  But the logic of his play demands that he does, because the drawdown would otherwise be irremediable.  Reminds one of Nick Leeson playing the Nikkei futures on behalf of the Baring Brothers Bank.  Now, I wish JP is right and Burry is wrong.  But when even Larry Summers repeatedly warns against a premature tapering of interest rate hikes, suggesting a Will E.

In his past posts he has explained the Feds position on raising rates. The Fed will raise rates just to drop them again.\n\nAs of right now QT is still in effect which is attempting to slowly reduce the amount of cash it has been pumping into the banking system since 2008 by letting a portion of its bond holdings to mature without reinvestment. At the same time the main focus is on rate hikes of the Federal Funds Rate. Investors are taking the dovishness in the last hike as positive, but this only affects overnight lending within the banking system. QT is the Fed letting off the gas in terms of buying US treasuries and suppressing their yields. As the Fed backs off, the price of the longer term bonds falls and yields skyrocket. \n\nSo now if the Fed wants to bring down inflation and KEEP it down, it must keep QT going through the pain it will bring. This is something it has tried multiple times since 2008 but has not been able to pull off. As the Fed lets the balance sheet roll off, treasuries will start flooding the banking system and the repo market will freeze and yields will rise farther. \n\nThis is where Uncle Sam gets in trouble because if no one wants it\u2019s bonds it cannot afford its bills. The interest rates themselves would be an issue for the government and businesses. At some point the US would go into default along with all your poorly financed businesses that depend on those low interest rates. \n\nThe Fed has to crash through all of that, to say the least, to get inflation back down.  It\u2019s other option is to back off the QT like is has at every point in 13 years since QE started and let prices continue to rise. This is the case for hyperinflation.

Each coupon has a date and dollar amount. The dates are quarterly, like 4/1/23, 7/1/23, \u2026 you can give the coupon to the government and get  all the way up to the \u201cmaturity date. The bond itself also has value. For example, you could buy a $10,000 3 year bond at 4%. Fed effectively prints money by selling these coupons and pays the coupons by printing money. This means that bond has 12 coupon that pays $100(=four coupons per year=$400, which is 4%. After 3 years, once you\u2019ve redeemed all of your coupons(bond has reached maturity), you can give the bond back to the government and get your $10,000 back.\n\nBonds are trades on the market. When things go south, fed starts buying them from people, and since fed prints money, they\u2019re just injecting money into the economy. They hold those coupons on their balance sheet as they are the owner of it. \n\nNow they can take money out of the economy by selling a ton of those bonds back to the open market, effectively taking money out of the economy. But they\u2019re not doing that. They\u2019re just not redeeming their bonds for money. Normally, this money would be entering the economy since institutional holders and every day investors would be reddening those coupons.\n\nFeds balance sheet is effectively a price stabilizing buffer. When people have too much money, they buy bonds, effectively spreading out the inflation of that excess money over however long that bond takes to mature. When there\u2019s not enough money, like in covid, they buy all of the bonds and bring the monetary supply back up. They then slowly sell them or let them expire when there\u2019s too much money in the economy, which introduces deflationary pressure. Letting bonds expire is the ideal way to this, as they\u2019re effectively eliminating that\u2019s inflation they spread over many years. \n\nIt\u2019s much like a bank account that can have a negative balance. You pull the money out and go negative at the time of crisis, then slowly add to it until you get a positive balance  when times are good, so you\u2019re ready for the next crisis. \n\nIt\u2019s meant to spread out random shortages or excesses of money over decades. Otherwise, you\u2019d have violent recessions and inflations every 5-10 years. Fed just pushes money in when there\u2019s a shortage, and pulls that money back out when there\u2019s an excess\n\nI don\u2019t really have a book recommendation, I\u2019ve just read many finance books.

I have been trading options for about 9 months (day trading) and am currently in my final year of university. I have just been admitted to some ivy league dental schools. In the first 3 months of trading, I have lost over 10k in \"the learning stage.\" Now I'm at a point where I consistently trade very well, using my risk management this allows me to make 50-100 dollars a day or about 1-2% of my whole account. At this point, I'm doing ok for myself and will definitely be making more in the near future. but my parents are practically forcing me to go to dental school and at this point, I don't see the need. They are claiming that it's gambling and told me if I can make 100k in 3 months I don't have to go to dental school. I explained to my parents that trading takes time and using my risk management I do not think this is possible. They turn off my computer when I enter my trades and take my phone away just for them to make me lose money and eventually give up on trading. Ever since I was 15 trading and stocks inspired me but all my siblings are in the medical field and they want me to follow. They show me the statistics of trading success rate and yell at me every day. I journal all my trades in excel and explain to them it's a game of percentages and not how much I make. They tell me your better off getting a minimum wage job if you're making 50 dollars a day and they don't understand that, that 50 dollars was a 40-50% trade. I'm so frustrated that at this point I'm ready to cave and just listen to my parents.
