Your income is typically lower when you are young so you can save your RRSP contribution room for when you are in a higher tax bracket when you are older. The idea of RRSP is that you defer paying income tax on what you contribute until you are retired and your income is lower. The big benefit of RRSP comes when you defer higher tax bracket income and then pay lower tax on that amount when you withdraw during retirement.\n\nThis can be debated though because you generally get a tax refund when you contribute to RRSP and if you invest that into TFSA or RRSP, you actually have more money invested and it is pretty close to a wash.\n\nIf you intend to buy a home, there is a new savings account coming this year called a FHSA that offers the benefits of TFSA and RRSP in one. I would MAX that first if you intend to buy a home. You will be able to contribute $8000/yr for 5 years. If you don't buy a home it can roll over into your RRSP.\n\nHere is the most important thing. Save 10% of everything you make starting now regardless of savings account. You do this consistently and get reasonable returns and you will be able to retire early if you desire.

Think of it as a container that shields whatever is inside of it from being taxed every year.  TFSA is the same in that regard.\n\nRRSP has an extra feature that TFSA doesn't, which is that the amounts you contribute can be used to artificially lower your earned income, helping you lower your present-tax income tax as well.\n\nBut RRSP also has some discouragements from taking money out which TFSA doesn't.\n\nThe government wants to encourage people to save for their own needs (TFSA) and for their own retirement (RRSP, Registered Pensions) and that's why the give these benefits.  \n\nBut they don't want rich people to just avoid all taxes, so each of the tax shelters have strict caps on how much you can put in them, and what kinds of things qualify.\n\nSo you don't really \"buy an RRSP\" or \"buy a TFSA\", even though that's the language we all say.  You buy various financial products, and you \"put them in to\" the RRSP or TFSA shelter structure.  \"Putting them in\" is done when you make the purchase/contribution, and that's by registering that you're doing that for government tracking purposes.\n\nYou ask what benefit RRSP has for someone in their 20's.  \n\nOne benefit is it gives you the chance to contribute money and not pay any taxes on the growth each year.  Those earnings can compound and become a very large nest egg for when you retire.\n\nThe other benefit is it can lower your present day tax payable.  RRSP claims reduce your reportable, taxable income.  In Canada, a person can earn up to $15,000 before they start having to pay tax.  So if you earned $20,000, you'll be paying income tax on $5,000 of that.  \"Buying a $5000 RRSP\" will reduce your taxable income from $20,000 to $15,000, you'd be essentially relieved of paying any income tax.\n\nIt's more powerful at higher tax brackets.  Say you make $50,000.  There's a tax bracket at around $45,000.  \"Buying a $5,000 RRSP\" would help you avoid the high tax rate on the dollars above $45,000.  I think (?) it can also help you stay qualified for certain benefit programs.  For example if benefit cuts off for people making over $47,000 per year, you could reduce your $50,000 income down to $46,000 by buying a $4000 RRSP so that you still get to receive those benefit payouts.\n\nAnd it's not like the $5000 or $4000 you contribute to RRSP is being \"spent\" or lost.  It's still yours, but not to accessed until later.\n\nProper personal finance planning in Canada absolutely requires that you understand TFSA and RRSP as they are the most crucial and available tools for the average person.", "created_utc": 1675902052.0, "edited": 1675902291.0, "id": "j7s2hu5", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10wvxvq/creating_an_rrsp_account_young/j7s2hu5/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_wovsy97", "body": "Read the book Becoming your own banker by Nelson Nash and look into the infinite banking concept first.

You can hold stocks and ETF's, bonds, GIC's, mutual funds and other eligible investments (just like an RRSP). You can also have MULTIPLE TFSA accounts such as one at a brokerage for your investments, and one for cash savings at another institution.\n\n**Question: How do I figure out my TFSA limit?**\n\nAnswer: Now is a good time for us to mention that you should sign up for CRA MyAccount since if you had it you would be able to check online right now. You can also call the CRA to ask about your TFSA limit (be prepared to identify yourself using prior year tax return information). Be aware that the CRA does not always have up-to-date information and that the limit is typically only updated yearly! Therefore it will not be likely to be updated for any current year activity. \n\n**Question: How do I report my TFSA on my tax return?**\n\nAnswer: You don't! The reporting of TFSA contributions, withdrawals, and income activity is taken care of by the institution that holds your TFSA.\n\n**Question: What is my contribution room?**\n\nAnswer: Your contribution room is based on the years that you meet all three conditions of: 18 or older, valid SIN and a tax resident of Canada. You do not get TFSA contribution room for years that you do not meet all three conditions (ie: do not have a valid SIN or are a non-resident of Canada). What happens inside your TFSA (holdings go up or down in value), has no impact on your contribution room. To refer to the different amounts in various years, see the CRA website: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Collection agencies cannot say they are going to sue and not go through with it. \n\nThe telling you to get a loan to pay in full is what they normally do.

Short? Yes. Seem simple and stupid? Yes. Indeed, without further explanation it wouldn\u2019t make any sense. Bear with me for a bit.\n\nWhy not panic? Because panicking tends to force a person to instantly try to find the fastest way to deal with an issue they have, like doing exactly what a phone call tells you to do. I remember getting a phone call from a scammer that tells me something akin to \u201ctell us your SIN number or we\u2019ll deport you\u201d in a very convincing way. Thank god i was slow and they hung up before my panicking self found and told them my information. So never let yourself go into panic mode and frantically do things. Calm yourself down first and consult someone you know you can trust (like your parents or closest friends).\n\nWhat do you do first? It\u2019s very simple, check your information. The first thing you need to do is to check whether whatever issue you have is true or not. Let\u2019s go back to my situation about the SIN number scam. Instead of scrambling to give the guy on the phone my information, i should have told him to let me call him back. Then i should sit for a while to calm myself down or do something that can help calm me down like contacting someone i can trust. \u201cKeep reassuring yourself that it\u2019s not a big deal and you can get through this.\u201d It\u2019s crucial to keep reminding yourself that you can get through this. Overthinking is fatal to a panic mental state and can lead you into a worse rabbit hole after all. After you feel more calm and less terrified, then reach out to whoever you can to see what you can do in this situation. Have no clue who to consult? Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal (or at least i think so). Ask around who you should contact in this situation (like you are currently doing now. You\u2019ll get a lot of good advice on where to start.). Then either try to book an appointment with whoever you need to ask or try to meet them as fast as possible. While you wait though, try not to panic. For that, I recommend getting \u201cSoundtracks\u201d by Jon Acuff. That book is a godsend for people struggling with overthinking and worrying all the time. \n\nDo know that this is only my thoughts on a general situation on worrying though.

Not a lawyer, not legal advice. \n\nFirst step, breathe and remember that this is not a crisis in this moment. Debt collecting is a process that takes time and requires specific steps. Your best option is to talk to the bank directly, ask them what the status of your account is, whether they use this law firm for their collections and do they know who Progressa even is. \n\nYou may be able to sort everything out with the bank directly.  If so, get any commitments in writing. \nIf not, here are some facts about Ontario debt collection:\n1. To get an order to collect this debt, the creditor has to go to small claims court. They have to serve you with a plaintiff's claim and you have the chance to file a defense and propose settlement terms (ie. A payment plan). \n2. Getting to court and mediation takes time, so use that time to save as much as you can towards the debt. \n3. Ask if they will accept a lump sum for x dollars now or over the course of several months instead of small payments over a much longer timeframe. It's actually cheaper for them because if they do end up going after your wages or bank accounts, it takes a long time and is a pain in the ass. \n4. Be honest, be professional, keep your promises and only make a deal you can actually handle. It's no good for anyone if you agree to something that is impossible and you end up defaulting. \n5. If you are unable to settle and they end up getting a judgment against you, you can limit the damage by filing an offer to settle in advance of the trial, where you basically agree to pay whatever you think is appropriate.  If they end up getting equal to or less than what you offered, they've wasted everyone's time and may not be entitled to costs, or may have to pay your costs. \n6. Only after a judgment is rendered may they go after your wages and bank accounts. But they also need to find out where you work and bank. This can be done by an examination, where you come to court and provide financial info. A lot of people enter into payment plans at this stage, so it's never too late. \n7.

I include only food items in the grocery category. I separate spending into \"groceries\" and \"household supplies\". Why? Because grocery stores are terrible place to buy household supplies. Grocery stores usually offer the best value for foods that are on sale and featured in their weekly flyers, but they tend to be VERY EXPENSIVE for household supplies (and pet food). So I buy most household supplies at Costco, and try to buy them only when they are on coupon-sale at Costco. That gives me the very best price.\n2. Roughly 3-4 times a month.\n3. You have to get to know the stores in your particular area, watch the flyers, and combine errands so you don't waste gas going from one to the other. I buy most of my groceries at No Frills, H&W Produce, and Costco (with infrequent trips to Asian, Latino and Indian markets). Costco is best for household supplies, *some* frozen/non-perishable food items, cheese, dairy products, rotisserie chicken.\n4. I think most people try to be honest but  a lot of them give inaccurate answers because they don't really keep track. There is also the problem of comparing \"apples and oranges\", because as you pointed out, some people include EVERYthing in the grocery category and other include only food.\n\nOther things to keep in mind:\n\nSome people have small grocery spending because they don't cook, and eat a lot of restaurant food instead. Obviously they are spending more money over all.\n\nTo get the best prices, you have to know what the lowest sale price is, for every item that you buy regularly, and only buy it when it is at that price. This takes a bit of research and there is a learning curve. But if you keep an eye on the flyers, almost everything goes on a deep-discount sale every 4-8 weeks or so. Example: Canned tomatoes cost $3, but the regular sale price is about $1/can. You can save a lot of money if you only buy it when it costs $1, and then stock up.\n\nI aim for a budget of $50 a week per adult, but it has gone up too $60/wk recently. Obviously this depends on the individual, of course; a large active person might need twice as much food as a small sedentary person.\n\nIf your neighbourhood store participates in the Flashfood app, you can get some items for half price or less when they are near their expiration date. This is a great deal for meat if you plan to cook it right away.\n\nI bake my own bread and sweets at home.", "created_utc": 1675879091.0, "edited": 1675879718.0, "id": "j7qezrw", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10x4a0j/new_to_canada_how_to_spend_less_on_groceries/j7qezrw/", "score": 4, "ups": 4}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_5s3e01t", "body": "Just because you can buy it at a grocery store, doesn\u2019t make it a grocery item.

When people talk about groceries, do they only count food? Because food is the least of the issue for us, but with stuff like toilet paper, laundry detergent, etc. costs add up quickly. \n\nI personally count food because it's my month to month expense. Toilet paper, laundry, etc it's an expense I pay every 2-3 months. Normally I buy those from Costco and when they are on sale.\n\nFor food, my gf is from Greece and we both cook regularly so she has showed me that you can make so many delicious food that are vegetable based, so we buy a lot of vegetables, fruits, if/when we buy meat/chicken it's when it's on sale, we cut them in portions and then freeze the rest for those nights or days we feel like a nice souvlaki or meat in the oven.\n\n\n>2. How many times per month do Canadians typically go grocery shopping? \n\nMyself and my gf, once a month in average, sometimes I need to run for parsley/tomatoes/green onions and I go to food basic/no frills for that\n\n>\n>3. What kind of stores do you go to? We tried different and the difference is not that much.\n\nCostco for the house supplies, cucumbers, tomatoes, chicken, meat (big chunk, cut them in portions and freeze for future use), fruits, eggs. So we might do this about 1.5 months (but to restock chicken/meat once every 4-5 I guess)\n\nFood basics/no frills if I run out of key ingredients like parsley, mints, cilantro, tomatoes (we consume a lot), I also go to a local Chinese supermarket where they give a lot more for about roughly the same price.\n\n\n>4. In your opinion, are people honest when they say how much they spend?

Prices are not the same everywhere. I probably shop two or three times per week, picking up small perishables most of the time because I already have the staples.\n* I don't break out things like toilet paper or soap, everything I buy at a grocery store is a consumable and you need a certain amount of all kinds of consumables to get by. A lot of groceries we buy aren't actually for eating - it's spice, it's oil, it's margarine, it's a bag of flour - so it's hard to account for looking at monthly costs. I would look at your three-month average to better account for that crazy Costco run where you bought four litres of ketchup that will last two until July.  \n* Having a pantry lets me stock up on staples - big bags of rice, big boxes of cereal, big bags of potatoes and onions, etc.\n* Meal planning is key. If we get disorganized and go into the week without a plan we spend far more on groceries and throw far more out.\n* I like to focus on simple dishes - any more than four or five ingredients and you're paying too much per portion. For example, I'm making a simple curry tonight - jasmine rice, curry powder, coconut milk, lentils, frozen peas. Two nights ago I made baked Gnocchi - toss the gnocchi in oil, add sliced cherry tomatoes, edamame beans, capers. Last week I made chili - crushed tomatoes, chili mix, white beans, and frozen mixed vegetables, which we ate with corn chips. Adding just one or two more ingredients to these meals adds $5-$10 or more to the cost of that meal. \n* Always make enough dinner for lunch the next day.\n* Keep breakfasts simple - oatmeal, cereal, granola, toast with peanut butter, a banana. You'll notice that I'm a vegetarian, but even if you're not there's no need to cook expensive meat for every meal, or to add sausages or bacon to your breakfast. Cutting back on meat in general will reduce your grocery costs significantly.", "created_utc": 1675882059.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7qmqco", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10x4a0j/new_to_canada_how_to_spend_less_on_groceries/j7qmqco/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_elewz", "body": "do price match", "created_utc": 1675882993.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7qp7x3", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10x4a0j/new_to_canada_how_to_spend_less_on_groceries/j7qp7x3/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_63zmwdn0", "body": "I\u2019m not sure how many stores you have to choose from in your area.

I also don't want a promotion because management isn't allowed in the union. \n\nIt might not be a lot compared to some people's idea of a good living, but I can make it work for me and I'm proud to be where I am. \n\nMy thought process here is that if this is my max earning potential, I need to plan the rest of my financial life in making this budget work realistically and for the long term. I'm trying to work out if that includes home ownership. \n\nI need to figure out my financial goals and modify my lifestyle to them well. This shouldn't be TOO hard, since I'm used to poverty. \n\nHere's the math break down:\n\nAfter taxes, CPP, EI, union dues and OMERS deductions/contributions, I think I should be making 45k per year net. Per month, that's $3,750 net. \n\nI may be wrong with my OMERS calculations - I haven't received a paystub yet, so please do tell me if you think 9k is too high an estimate.\n\nKeeping the following categories in mind, I'm seeing how much I can realistically afford to save.\n\n- Rent/Utilities/Wifi: $1800/month (hoping I can reduce, but it's tough out there)\n- Groceries: $400\n- Transportation $250 (TTC + occasional Uber + splitting gas with friends)\n- Personal care/hygiene/grooming: $100\n- Going out/Dating - $100\n- Clothing: $100\n- Entertainment/Hobbies: $50/month \n- Phone/data plan: $80/month (willing to reduce, it's hard without a corporate/bundle/family plan options)\n- Work certification savings: $50/month (employer doesn't pay). \n- Technology replacement savings: $75/month (to go towards replacement of phones, TVs, laptops, computers. Right now I have a 6 year old phone and a 12 year old laptop, so these expense are coming soon).\n- Subscription services: $35/month for streaming services I share with my family\n- Gifts: $40/month\n- Furniture/decor: $40/month\n- Vacation/trips: $30/month (I'll probably only go once every 5 years with this lol..)\n- Emergency savings/misc savings: $50/month\n\nTotal: $3200\n\nRemainder for savings: $550\n\nThis budget feels very realistic for the long term. It's generous and overcompensates in a few areas to leave a realistic buffer.\n\nGiven that I have a defined benefit pension plan with my employer, it makes sense to me to save towards a down payment. If I can own a home by 65 then a reduced pension is very manageable because I'll have drastically reduced housing costs for my 70+ year old self.\n\nBut I worked out the math.\n\nSuppose I save $550 a month for 15 years. By then I'll be 45 years old. That's only $99,000. \n\nThe cost of a condo in the GTA is well over $650,000. By the time I'm 45, I'll have 15% saved towards the downpayment of a condo based on ***today's*** prices.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that my wage will be increased according to inflation and the cost of housing in particular. This way, we can kind of negate inflation on both sides. Realistically, no one knows what will happen. I'm happy to adjust that simple prediction if I've got hard sourceable facts. I know how compound interest works, but inflation exists... perhaps they're related and roughly cancel each other out XD\n\nStarting a mortgage at 45 with only 15% down might not even qualify me for a mortgage, and possibly not one that allows me to pay off my home before I retire. \n\nI'm very discouraged.\n\nYou might say, ***\"Well, spend less! You're spending too much on XYZ, I could TOTALLY LIVE ON LESS AND YOU SHOULD TOO.\"*** \n\nSuppose I suppress my eye roll and listen to the boomer advice for the next 10 years. I suppose I chuck out the avocado toast equivalents across the board. \n\nI go out less, cancel my TV subscriptions, maybe revert to a flip phone, stop dating, and eat instant ramen frequently for the duration of my 30s. Suppose this allows me to reduce my budget by 20% across the board. It would be very hard to do since rent is the biggest expense and largely out of my control, but say I cut everything by 20%. \n\nPer month, I'd be saving an extra $640, more than doubling my monthly savings. This could bring my savings to $214k. Assuming I could get a condo for $650k (again, ignoring inflation), that's over 30%! Maybe I stand a chance?\n\nSo I plugged in some values into this mortgage calculator. $200,000 down on a $650,000 home (again, assume my savings, inflation and housing costs are inflated but inflated comparably... idk how it works but idk how else to do the math. \n\nI put my 80k salary with 0 debts to repay. \n\nI still got denied for a mortgage for the following reason: \n\n***FCAC uses a Gross Debt Service (GDS) ratio of 32% and a Total Debt Service (TDS) ratio of 40% in this tool as a guideline. You may still qualify for a mortgage even if your GDS and TDS ratios are slightly higher. However, higher GDS and TDS ratios mean that you are increasing the risk of taking on more debt than you can afford.***\n\n***You will likely be denied for the required mortgage amount.You will likely be denied for a mortgage amount of $455,000.00 since either your GDS ratio (48.90%) exceeds 32.00% or your TDS ratio (48.90%) exceeds 40.00%.***\n\nI've planned the next 15 years of my life and I can't afford a mortgage. Even with conservative estimates, excluding ever having a pet or car, I can't buy a home. \n\nShould I just... Get a few dogs instead and enjoy my 30s and 40s a bit more instead of stressing about home ownership?", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10wl2zl/does_homeownership_even_make_sense_for_toronto/", "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10wl2zl/does_homeownership_even_make_sense_for_toronto/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10wl2zl", "author": "t2_vt1gc5n7", "commentCount": 254, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_vd28we4t", "body": "Short Answer:\n\nYou will never qualify for a 650k condo with a 80k salary, based off of the numbers you\u2019ve provided here.\n\nLong Answer:\n\nIf you had a 300k down payment, with a 80k salary - yes you could afford a 1 bedroom condo.\n\nAlternatively, if you met a partner that earned a modest salary of 40k, you would qualify for a 1 bedroom condo with a down payment of around 100k.\n\nThe reality is that single income earners, by and large, cannot own property in the GTA anymore.

But that aside, whether or not you end up with a house, for gods' sake please do enjoy your 30s and 40s. Enjoyment doesn't have to be very expensive, although on a tight budget like yours, things can add up quick.\n\nTwo things.\n\nAs your salary increases eventually, try to raise your savings rate accordingly. Compound interest is not to be disregarded, but combined with continuous yearly contribution raises it makes more of a difference. This might still not be enough to buy property at the time, or it might, who knows. Your budgeting and forecasting seems solid and I won't doubt it. Relatedly, if your rental is rent-protected, it might not rise as fast as your income in absolute dollar terms. That extra money can go towards savings.\n\nSecondly, invested money can be used for either real estate or retirement. Sometimes real estate will be ahead because of huge leverage. Sometimes the housing market will pull back and people are underwater with their houses for several years when VGRO would have done better. Either way, you'll have money in your FHSA, you'll have money in your TFSA, perhaps some in your RRSP. You can decide how to use it then. You don't have to make great plans about it now if the outcome is \"try to save while enjoying your life\" in both scenarios.\n\nThose would be the main points. Sure you can try to optimize the small stuff. Going from an $80/m phone bill to, say, $113 for the entire year (I'm pretty happy with my newly reduced Freedom Mobile @ 50G/y plan) makes a sizeable difference. It's still only a drop in the bucket when looking at savings for a down payment.\n\nIf you're not looking at changing careers, the most important thing you need to work out is how to make the next 30-40 years enjoyable without overextending yourself. If you're not burning out at your job, and you put those $550 plus inflation (or more) into savings, and you enjoy your life with good friends plus apartment for yourself, then you should be in a pretty good spot to retire comfortably without having owned property. Owning can pay off, but it's also not a necessity to live a good life.\n\nBest of luck.", "created_utc": 1675835033.0, "edited": 1675836145.0, "id": "j7oa7qi", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10wl2zl/does_homeownership_even_make_sense_for_toronto/j7oa7qi/", "score": 7, "ups": 7}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_d6mmft3o", "body": "IMHO, Toronto doesnt make sense on a 80K salary.

Looks like you have great perks to be working where you are and you've done a great job to be able to save money while still being able to enjoy a life comfortably. Definitely no signs of struggling to stay afloat. \n\nDoes it make sense to own a home with the current salary? \n\nIt depends. What are you looking to achieve for owning a place? Why is it important? \n\nPerhaps the question could begin with why would you want to own a home and how can it benefit you financially/mentally/emotionally? And following up to that, is it possible to do so and how?\n\nIs the goal to achieve this solely by yourself the most important aspect? Or being able to get your foot in the door to home ownership early on more important? \n\nHousing prices are constantly increasing, that may seem depressing but it can also been seen as an opportunity for growth. That is if you can get into the system early, or ASAP.\n\nHaving a roommate can be a headache but it doesn't have to be a long term for life plan. In the short term of reducing your biggest expense, you could potentially save half of your rent and double your savings. Putting this money towards your TFSA and invested in stocks or mutual funds or GICs would be a lot better than simply saving as cash. Also, you could be investing towards RRSP and reduce your income tax which is also more savings. You would be able to also withdraw from your RRSP later on as a loan towards buying a home.\n\nInvest your money and time in things that can grow. Invest into career growth that will benefit you mentally and financially over time. Find something you enjoy that can turn into a side hustle. Could even be dog sitting, best of both worlds to have companionship while being paid. Or teach your skills to juniors as a tutor out of your work days. These may seem like small but can oftentimes bring many unexpected opportunities.\n\nIt takes a lot of hard work to be where you are and it's great you are super independent. Having a team helps a lot and would not diminish your own accomplishments. Whether that be having a roommate, finding a long time partner, or receiving help from family. You share the gains as well as the losses.\n\nWe all know the math, increase incoming, decrease outgoing, or both, would yield greater return.\n\nIf home ownership for long term is really important, then the short term discomfort of splitting cost with roommate, borrow money from family, switching jobs, cutting down to bare minimum spending would be worth it.

Passive savings will get you no where. You need to be putting that money into an RRSP to deffer some taxable income. Now you could just contribute $550 a month or talk to your bank about an RRSP line of credit. Borrow 10k against this and have a reasonable monthly payment sub $500. Once you do you now have 10k working for you in whatever risk portfolio you select. Plus, you get a tax break of approximately $300 for every $1000 in RRSP. This means first year return will be around $3000.\n\nNow you have $3000 back, you can either pay down your loan amount by $3000 or put it in a TFSA. If you choose to pay down your loan and you've paid $300 a month you can use it again to $10k and for the sake of easy math add $6000 to your RRSP, while giving an $1800 tax return.\n\nPay down loan again or roll into TFSA. If you borrow again you can contribute $4000 to RRSP and get a $1200 return.\n\nThis way has you at $20k savings in 3 years, moderate market exposure and only liable for 10k debts below your monthly savings amount.\n\nWith this model the capital monthly cost rate is $300 per month but puts you around 20k savings, basically equal to saving passively $550 per month with zero market exposure.\n\nThis is the best model to use if you want to build up enough in your RRSP for the max contribution of $35k.  There are some rules your bank will explain like outstanding amount has to become a personal loan and 90 day rule prior to purchase.\n\nHome ownership is not a be all end all.

The market goes up and down, if you've got money saved up when its down it can definitely help. Keep up the dating, probably a much better chance of owning a home if you get in a serious relationship with someone and plan on spending your life together. I mean realistically that's more important than owning any home but also does come with the benefit of both of you earning, cutting down on costs like rent, 'free' entertainment by just spending quality time or whatever together, still can put money into other things but if both of you work well together and have the goal of saving up for a house, may be easier to encourage each other to save better. \n\nOther than that maybe getting lucky in some investment funds? Not the solid answer most people would want lol, any side hustle ideas? \n\nBut realistically yeah if you're in a serious relationship with someone and you guys live together and split the rent, thats 10.8k a year saved, leading to a savings of an additional 162k in your 15 year time frame for a total of 261k. May take 3 years to find that person that's right for you & whatever, may take a year, who knows, no need to rush it for financial situations because that relationship will affect the rest of your life so make sure they're good for you even if there's a couple years/months lost in 'savings' lol. \n\nReducing your subscriptions and other expenses might lead to 100, 200, 300 dollars saved, but just splitting your rent in half would triple that number in one go. The elephant chunk of your expenses is rent. If you're brave enough to try roommate situations, the more people you live with the more you'll be able to save, really look out for egos or unknowns that can sour a living situation, but if you guys all get along you basically are extended famillies, or at least private individuals who respect each others space and feel comfortable living there. If you're brave enough/have the opportunity to move in with family that would welcome it, even if you contributed to costs you'd still be saving a ton of money. \n\nAlso take care of yourself, me personally if I'm burnt out I spend more so it can throw a wrench in saving plans if you put yourself in a living situation that's not healthy for you or you oversave in areas and don't get the life satisfaction you need to counter burnout. Ultimately though if in the next few years you can find a way to save on rent it'l help a lot, even if it wasn't cut in half but you found a nice situation for 1500, that extra 300 a month will still give your savings a big boost (54 grand more in your 15 year timeframe).", "created_utc": 1675899865.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7rxbf5", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10wl2zl/does_homeownership_even_make_sense_for_toronto/j7rxbf5/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_nqudz4he", "body": "I\u2019ve suggested to family members in the same situation who are currently renting and want to stay in the GTA, to purchase a lower priced lot in a smaller town. \n\nGet financing to build a house, and then flip it when complete.

It's clear that you've done your homework and you know what you're up against.

In the long run, over centuries, housing has more or less tracked inflation. It's also had a terrific run over the last 15 years or so. We also know that demand for housing won't go away in dense cities and their surrounding overflow areas.\n\nBut also, it can't keep growing at anywhere close to 7% for much longer unless inflation and payraises stay at a similar level. To drastically misquote Lincoln, you can increase prices for some wealthy people for a long time, and you can feed a wide-reaching housing bubble that affects everyone for some time. But in the long run, income for the majority of people and housing cost are necessarily linked.\n\nProperty prices and interest rates are also linked with an inverse relationship btw, because cost of living must approximately stay the same after inflation. It'll be interesting to see what the recent rate increases will do to property prices if they stick around for a while.\n\nI believe that real estate will do well for long-term owners because the massive leverage of a mortgage requires less of a percentage gain than a regular unleveraged investment.

It would have \"been so easy for me to take home 5-figure weekly salaries\" while I was in university, as long as I ignored the fact I was trying to scam my fellow students... The 'boss' even showed me some deposits into their bank account for that kind of money, they just happened to leave out the part where they'd already scammed about 300 other people into policies and another 50 or so into 'working' for them, until I asked about what it takes to get that kind of income. I noped out of there really fucking hard. I almost died laughing when I said \"sooo, this is a pyramid scheme?\" and the 'boss' almost fell over themselves trying to defend and explain how it's \"not a pyramid scheme, because you recruit people and sell products, and then you get a kick-back on everything your recruits sell, eventually you don't even have to work and you make 6-figures!\"\n\nThat person I knew really gave it a go for about 7 years.

What they're selling is a perfectly legal, normal product.\n\nPeople call them pyramid schemes but that's technically not true. MLMs are pyramid shaped but they're not pyramid schemes.\n\nWhere the problem comes in is that until you get to that point you make shit money (less than min wage). So like 95% of people quit in the first 6 months. So you have to be recruiting like 30-40 people at a *minimum*. And then those people need to recruit like mad, and then those people need to recruit like mad, etc.\n\nSo to be successful and have a strong pyramid below you, you will have had to recruit like 100,000 people. Some places have done the math and for a city of 1m people you can only have a few successful people in that given market.\n\nHence it's all about recruiting. You have to recruit like a man man, and they in turn have to recruit like crazy, and have to hire crazy recruiters to work under them.\n\nAt least with Primerica it's not a physical product.

The company had restructured and made working a nightmare, so I left shortly after him and was hunting for work. He had a son, about my daughters age and invited our family to come to the private, community provided splash park he had access too one weekend. We went, it was fun and that was that. It did start raining extremely hard and storming, so we left early and I assume they couldn't pitch properly. About a week later he asked me out for a coffee, but another friend/co-worker had pre-warned me that he was an Amway rep. I show up, he makes small talks then jumps into the pitch. I wasn't interested and we haven't talked since.  \n\n\nThe second time was way more insulting and happened maybe a month after the first. I had applied to a mysteriously vague job posting for \"Sales Managers\" on some website. While I used linkedin for most of my applications I also liked to explore other sites. I had found linkedin to be the chop shop recruiters favored tool, while other sites sometimes worked better. I apply for this role, with no expectations. I got a call back within a day, but the connection sucked (turns out it didn't) and this person apologizes and texts me, arranging a meeting and sends me an email about the meeting to go to a specific hotel. I know the hotel and they have a decent bar/lounge, so figured that was why. I was wrong. I show up, suit/tie, talk to the manager who was a previous customer and such, then I noticed a flood of people in tshirts or golf shirts, suspiciously energetic music etc. This guy shows up, with his wife and is trying to recruit me for some financial services scheme. Don't know what it was. He brings me to \"his boss\". Now, the guy trying to recruit me can barely speak english, he wife is dressed in some extravagant but traditional looking African outfit, he has a suit on. His boss, is wearing a platinum colored suit, black silk shirt and has absolutely massive, diamond studs in his ears. It was a bit of an over the top, look and he was greasy. The way he carried himself, the way he talked. I sized him up, he did the same to me and within 30 seconds he knew he wasn't recruiting me and I wasn't interested. I left a minute later.  \n\n\nThe final time was about a year later. A mutual coworker mention he worked with some financial services thing, pushed it hard on Linkedin messages to me, then told the recruiter for my area to reach out. I wasn't interested and told both that, but they still tried for a few weeks until I just stopped responding.   \n\n\nIt really is shocking the tactics they go through.

If you seriously want to know more it's on you to educate yourself. You've taken one concept, Browser fingerprinting, and extrapolated an incorrect use case.\n\nBrowser fingerprinting is a very real privacy concern, and mostly came about because users were blocking or clearing cookies (or using incognito mode). However the users are passive in this case, and fingerprinting is not perfect, but \"good enough\" when taken across a large swathe of users.\n\nThe information collected is done so either via scripts or HTTP headers. All of which originates from or round-trips through the users Browser. It is encrypted *only* as it's sent from the Browser - before that the user is free to view or modify it anyway they want. Download a free intercepting proxy and play for yourself if you wish, Burp Suite is pretty much the gold standard for pentesters currently. This means that the user (AKA the person you want to \"hardware ban\") chooses exactly what the server (AKA Reddit) gets to receive. If they don't want to send the \"fingerprint\" (however it may be generated) they are free remove or edit it as they wish.\n\nSo in short, Fingerprinting can be used for passive tracking with a reasonable success rate, but you cannot rely on it as a security control where the nefarious user is actively trying to circumvent it.\n\nNow a \"hardware ban\" would infer that a piece of information tied to the client-side hardware is being transmitted and cannot be altered by our nefarious user. Either because it's encrypted or digitally signed.

When I ask for further explanation, the response is \"Our system doesn't show us that\". I've also verified the collection agency as being legit.  \n\n\nI have all the documentation for this transaction as I needed it for the expense report.

They briefly stopped collection action to verify with the creditor, then came back with \"Our client states there is no payment towards your balance\" and they resumed collection action.  \n\n\nThe collection agency asked for a bank statement, which I was able to provide immediately. Exact amount showed as charged. That's where I'm at right now. Let's see what they come back with.  \n\n\nThe silliest part is they're trying to collect an amount under $1k.
