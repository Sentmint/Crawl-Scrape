He assured me that a new card had been ordered and would arrive by Friday. I was put on hold as the caller verified my information, during which I locked my credit card to prevent unauthorized transactions. The caller then asked me to unlock my card in order to reverse the unauthorized transactions, and after verifying my payment information put me on hold again.

Think of it as a container that shields whatever is inside of it from being taxed every year.  TFSA is the same in that regard.\n\nRRSP has an extra feature that TFSA doesn't, which is that the amounts you contribute can be used to artificially lower your earned income, helping you lower your present-tax income tax as well.\n\nBut RRSP also has some discouragements from taking money out which TFSA doesn't.\n\nThe government wants to encourage people to save for their own needs (TFSA) and for their own retirement (RRSP, Registered Pensions) and that's why the give these benefits.  \n\nBut they don't want rich people to just avoid all taxes, so each of the tax shelters have strict caps on how much you can put in them, and what kinds of things qualify.\n\nSo you don't really \"buy an RRSP\" or \"buy a TFSA\", even though that's the language we all say.  You buy various financial products, and you \"put them in to\" the RRSP or TFSA shelter structure.  \"Putting them in\" is done when you make the purchase/contribution, and that's by registering that you're doing that for government tracking purposes.\n\nYou ask what benefit RRSP has for someone in their 20's.  \n\nOne benefit is it gives you the chance to contribute money and not pay any taxes on the growth each year.  Those earnings can compound and become a very large nest egg for when you retire.\n\nThe other benefit is it can lower your present day tax payable.  RRSP claims reduce your reportable, taxable income.  In Canada, a person can earn up to $15,000 before they start having to pay tax.  So if you earned $20,000, you'll be paying income tax on $5,000 of that.  \"Buying a $5000 RRSP\" will reduce your taxable income from $20,000 to $15,000, you'd be essentially relieved of paying any income tax.\n\nIt's more powerful at higher tax brackets.  Say you make $50,000.  There's a tax bracket at around $45,000.  \"Buying a $5,000 RRSP\" would help you avoid the high tax rate on the dollars above $45,000.  I think (?) it can also help you stay qualified for certain benefit programs.  For example if benefit cuts off for people making over $47,000 per year, you could reduce your $50,000 income down to $46,000 by buying a $4000 RRSP so that you still get to receive those benefit payouts.\n\nAnd it's not like the $5000 or $4000 you contribute to RRSP is being \"spent\" or lost.

Your income is typically lower when you are young so you can save your RRSP contribution room for when you are in a higher tax bracket when you are older. The idea of RRSP is that you defer paying income tax on what you contribute until you are retired and your income is lower. The big benefit of RRSP comes when you defer higher tax bracket income and then pay lower tax on that amount when you withdraw during retirement.\n\nThis can be debated though because you generally get a tax refund when you contribute to RRSP and if you invest that into TFSA or RRSP, you actually have more money invested and it is pretty close to a wash.\n\nIf you intend to buy a home, there is a new savings account coming this year called a FHSA that offers the benefits of TFSA and RRSP in one. I would MAX that first if you intend to buy a home. You will be able to contribute $8000/yr for 5 years. If you don't buy a home it can roll over into your RRSP.\n\nHere is the most important thing. Save 10% of everything you make starting now regardless of savings account. You do this consistently and get reasonable returns and you will be able to retire early if you desire. I recommend using Wealthsimple or Quest Trade self managed accounts and buying XEQT or VEQT and never touching it. These are market index funds and in the long run will grow with the market.

Thirty-five years later, that is now worth $9500.  Now that doesn't sound like a huge amount, but it equates to about $60 a month for the rest of my life.

You can hold stocks and ETF's, bonds, GIC's, mutual funds and other eligible investments (just like an RRSP). You can also have MULTIPLE TFSA accounts such as one at a brokerage for your investments, and one for cash savings at another institution.\n\n**Question: How do I figure out my TFSA limit?**\n\nAnswer: Now is a good time for us to mention that you should sign up for CRA MyAccount since if you had it you would be able to check online right now. You can also call the CRA to ask about your TFSA limit (be prepared to identify yourself using prior year tax return information).

Therefore it will not be likely to be updated for any current year activity. \n\n**Question: How do I report my TFSA on my tax return?**\n\nAnswer: You don't! The reporting of TFSA contributions, withdrawals, and income activity is taken care of by the institution that holds your TFSA.\n\n**Question: What is my contribution room?**\n\nAnswer: Your contribution room is based on the years that you meet all three conditions of: 18 or older, valid SIN and a tax resident of Canada. You do not get TFSA contribution room for years that you do not meet all three conditions (ie: do not have a valid SIN or are a non-resident of Canada). What happens inside your TFSA (holdings go up or down in value), has no impact on your contribution room. To refer to the different amounts in various years, see the CRA website: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can also call the CRA to ask about your TFSA limit (be prepared to identify yourself using prior year tax return information). Be aware that the CRA does not always have up-to-date information and that the limit is typically only updated yearly! Therefore it will not be likely to be updated for any current year activity. \n\n**Question: How do I report my TFSA on my tax return?**\n\nAnswer: You don't! The reporting of TFSA contributions, withdrawals, and income activity is taken care of by the institution that holds your TFSA.\n\n**Question: What is my contribution room?**\n\nAnswer: Your contribution room is based on the years that you meet all three conditions of: 18 or older, valid SIN and a tax resident of Canada. You do not get TFSA contribution room for years that you do not meet all three conditions (ie: do not have a valid SIN or are a non-resident of Canada). What happens inside your TFSA (holdings go up or down in value), has no impact on your contribution room. To refer to the different amounts in various years, see the CRA website: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Both as a manager at a collection agency and with a major bank before moving to my current career path. \n\nThere are law firms out there now which essentially act as collection agencies. It\u2019s a way for exploiting loopholes in legislation and instilling fear in debtors. Collection agencies cannot say they are going to sue and not go through with it. \n\nThe telling you to get a loan to pay in full is what they normally do. They work on commission from the lenders and a receiver a percentage of everything they recover. They more they recover, they more they make. The more they recover the more business they also get from the lender. \n\nIn theory getting a loan to pay in full IS better for you. Not only will it result in the bad debt being paid, but you now have a new piece of good credit and can start rebuilding your credit history. The problem is that your credit is shit and collection agencies usually tell people to borrow from high risk lenders that charge obscene interest rates. They\u2019re often the only people that will lend to people with bad credit and insignificant net worth. If there\u2019s a way someone can help you borrow from a bank, that\u2019s a much better option for you. \n\nThe above being said, for $6000 they\u2019re probably not going to sue you. There are costs involved in suing and the agency absorbs those costs. It\u2019s also not a guarantee if being paid in a timely manner or at all. They could actually lose money by suing you. The risk outweighs the reward. \n\nRegarding payments, they will not refuse them. They cannot refuse them. You can just start sending them cheques or if you want, you can still pay the lender directly. The lender will still have to pay a commission to the agency, but it may be easier and the agency will leave you alone.

Once you admit the debt it yours, they can start chasing you again. \n\n\\- If the debt IS legit and you owe it, call the company and see if you can work something out.

Short? Yes. Seem simple and stupid? Yes. Indeed, without further explanation it wouldn\u2019t make any sense. Bear with me for a bit.\n\nWhy not panic? Because panicking tends to force a person to instantly try to find the fastest way to deal with an issue they have, like doing exactly what a phone call tells you to do. I remember getting a phone call from a scammer that tells me something akin to \u201ctell us your SIN number or we\u2019ll deport you\u201d in a very convincing way. Thank god i was slow and they hung up before my panicking self found and told them my information. So never let yourself go into panic mode and frantically do things. Calm yourself down first and consult someone you know you can trust (like your parents or closest friends).\n\nWhat do you do first? It\u2019s very simple, check your information. The first thing you need to do is to check whether whatever issue you have is true or not. Let\u2019s go back to my situation about the SIN number scam. Instead of scrambling to give the guy on the phone my information, i should have told him to let me call him back. Then i should sit for a while to calm myself down or do something that can help calm me down like contacting someone i can trust. \u201cKeep reassuring yourself that it\u2019s not a big deal and you can get through this.\u201d It\u2019s crucial to keep reminding yourself that you can get through this. Overthinking is fatal to a panic mental state and can lead you into a worse rabbit hole after all. After you feel more calm and less terrified, then reach out to whoever you can to see what you can do in this situation. Have no clue who to consult? Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s normal (or at least i think so). Ask around who you should contact in this situation (like you are currently doing now. You\u2019ll get a lot of good advice on where to start.). Then either try to book an appointment with whoever you need to ask or try to meet them as fast as possible. While you wait though, try not to panic. For that, I recommend getting \u201cSoundtracks\u201d by Jon Acuff. That book is a godsend for people struggling with overthinking and worrying all the time. \n\nDo know that this is only my thoughts on a general situation on worrying though.

Not a lawyer, not legal advice. \n\nFirst step, breathe and remember that this is not a crisis in this moment. Debt collecting is a process that takes time and requires specific steps. Your best option is to talk to the bank directly, ask them what the status of your account is, whether they use this law firm for their collections and do they know who Progressa even is. \n\nYou may be able to sort everything out with the bank directly.  If so, get any commitments in writing. \nIf not, here are some facts about Ontario debt collection:\n1. To get an order to collect this debt, the creditor has to go to small claims court. They have to serve you with a plaintiff's claim and you have the chance to file a defense and propose settlement terms (ie. A payment plan). \n2. Getting to court and mediation takes time, so use that time to save as much as you can towards the debt. \n3. Ask if they will accept a lump sum for x dollars now or over the course of several months instead of small payments over a much longer timeframe. It's actually cheaper for them because if they do end up going after your wages or bank accounts, it takes a long time and is a pain in the ass. \n4. Be honest, be professional, keep your promises and only make a deal you can actually handle. It's no good for anyone if you agree to something that is impossible and you end up defaulting. \n5. If you are unable to settle and they end up getting a judgment against you, you can limit the damage by filing an offer to settle in advance of the trial, where you basically agree to pay whatever you think is appropriate.  If they end up getting equal to or less than what you offered, they've wasted everyone's time and may not be entitled to costs, or may have to pay your costs. \n6. Only after a judgment is rendered may they go after your wages and bank accounts. But they also need to find out where you work and bank. This can be done by an examination, where you come to court and provide financial info. A lot of people enter into payment plans at this stage, so it's never too late. \n7.

I include only food items in the grocery category. I separate spending into \"groceries\" and \"household supplies\". Why? Because grocery stores are terrible place to buy household supplies. Grocery stores usually offer the best value for foods that are on sale and featured in their weekly flyers, but they tend to be VERY EXPENSIVE for household supplies (and pet food). So I buy most household supplies at Costco, and try to buy them only when they are on coupon-sale at Costco. That gives me the very best price.\n2. Roughly 3-4 times a month.\n3. You have to get to know the stores in your particular area, watch the flyers, and combine errands so you don't waste gas going from one to the other. I buy most of my groceries at No Frills, H&W Produce, and Costco (with infrequent trips to Asian, Latino and Indian markets). Costco is best for household supplies, *some* frozen/non-perishable food items, cheese, dairy products, rotisserie chicken.\n4. I think most people try to be honest but  a lot of them give inaccurate answers because they don't really keep track. There is also the problem of comparing \"apples and oranges\", because as you pointed out, some people include EVERYthing in the grocery category and other include only food.\n\nOther things to keep in mind:\n\nSome people have small grocery spending because they don't cook, and eat a lot of restaurant food instead. Obviously they are spending more money over all.\n\nTo get the best prices, you have to know what the lowest sale price is, for every item that you buy regularly, and only buy it when it is at that price. This takes a bit of research and there is a learning curve. But if you keep an eye on the flyers, almost everything goes on a deep-discount sale every 4-8 weeks or so. Example: Canned tomatoes cost $3, but the regular sale price is about $1/can. You can save a lot of money if you only buy it when it costs $1, and then stock up.\n\nI aim for a budget of $50 a week per adult, but it has gone up too $60/wk recently. Obviously this depends on the individual, of course; a large active person might need twice as much food as a small sedentary person.\n\nIf your neighbourhood store participates in the Flashfood app, you can get some items for half price or less when they are near their expiration date.

Prices are not the same everywhere. I probably shop two or three times per week, picking up small perishables most of the time because I already have the staples.\n* I don't break out things like toilet paper or soap, everything I buy at a grocery store is a consumable and you need a certain amount of all kinds of consumables to get by. A lot of groceries we buy aren't actually for eating - it's spice, it's oil, it's margarine, it's a bag of flour - so it's hard to account for looking at monthly costs. I would look at your three-month average to better account for that crazy Costco run where you bought four litres of ketchup that will last two until July.  \n* Having a pantry lets me stock up on staples - big bags of rice, big boxes of cereal, big bags of potatoes and onions, etc.\n* Meal planning is key. If we get disorganized and go into the week without a plan we spend far more on groceries and throw far more out.\n* I like to focus on simple dishes - any more than four or five ingredients and you're paying too much per portion. For example, I'm making a simple curry tonight - jasmine rice, curry powder, coconut milk, lentils, frozen peas. Two nights ago I made baked Gnocchi - toss the gnocchi in oil, add sliced cherry tomatoes, edamame beans, capers. Last week I made chili - crushed tomatoes, chili mix, white beans, and frozen mixed vegetables, which we ate with corn chips. Adding just one or two more ingredients to these meals adds $5-$10 or more to the cost of that meal. \n* Always make enough dinner for lunch the next day.\n* Keep breakfasts simple - oatmeal, cereal, granola, toast with peanut butter, a banana. You'll notice that I'm a vegetarian, but even if you're not there's no need to cook expensive meat for every meal, or to add sausages or bacon to your breakfast.

You don't have to do this I'm just showing you it's possible to still eat a large meal everyday and have it cost less than $100 a month. \n\nI also wore the same clothes everyday for probably a week or so until changing into new ones, would only shower like once a week too. So I barely did any laundry or used any water at all. \n\nNow i just eat what I feel like everyday, I shower most days, but I still like to wear the same clothes for a while. Maybe in the summer time I change my clothes more often though. \n\nEvery summer I also grow a huge vegetable garden and get enough veggies to eat them every day for 1-2 months while still giving away 2/3 of what I grow. I like eating alot more veggies at the end of every summer. It's a nice seasonal refresher. \n\nHaven't had a cell phone plan in 6 years. I do have a cell phone but I didn't have to buy it either. My dad just gave me his old one when he bought a new one. And I get by using just Wi-Fi and messenger to talk to anyone. I don't miss having a cell number at all. I use my phone everyday at home but when I go places and do things I'm not still glued to my phone like some people. I really just enjoy being wherever I am. \n\nAnyways.

It's more difficult in the winter; in the summer, a lot of stores tend to have a small greenhouse section, and there are often plant sellers in farmers' markets and in vacant lots.  They usually have herbs because people grow them as annuals, so they buy them every year.\n\nIf you can't find any potted plants you want to grow, the alternative is to get a bag of peat-free compost mix (I mix my own, but it's pretty similar to [this one from West Coast Seeds](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/products/mind-soil-worm-castings-seedling-mix-7-5l)), some containers (you can use anything from milk jugs to take out containers to actual pots--just make sure that they're deep and wide enough to accommodate the plants you're going to grow), and some seeds that you'd like to grow.  Seeds are easy to find at hardware stores or on the internet.  If you're not used to growing anything, I'd recommend browsing West Coast Seeds's selection because they provide more information on growing their seeds than other seed sellers I've seen.  For example, they have a difficulty rating for most of their plant varieties and recommendations on how to grow each one, so you can get an idea of what might work for you before you go out and buy seeds.  It might seem like it'll take a while, but you could harvest [sprouts](https://sprouting.com/how-to-grow-sprouts/) in three or four days, [microgreens](https://www.westcoastseeds.com/collections/microgreens-seeds) in two weeks, or lettuce in three or four weeks, for example.  If you're looking specifically for herbs, several herbs (like basil, coriander, dill, chives, parsley, and thyme) can be grown as microgreens.\n\nIf you do find potted herbs at a grocery store, some of them can be propagated through cuttings, which means that one healthy basil plant, for example, can [give you several plants for free](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/herbs/basil/propagating-basil.htm)!

This trip required me to rent a vehicle in which I drove up and down the Alaska Highway (cool experience). Transaction went smoothly when dropping off the vehicle, no damage, full tank of gas, paid by CC and got the receipt for my expense report.  \n\n\nFast forward to December 2022, I get a \"snail mail\" letter from a collection agency stating that I owe the rental company for that rental plus interest. **Now, before you yell SCAM**, I have called the rental company several times and all they can tell me is \"you have an outstanding balance\". When I ask for further explanation, the response is \"Our system doesn't show us that\". I've also verified the collection agency as being legit.  \n\n\nI have all the documentation for this transaction as I needed it for the expense report. I sent the original receipt to the collection agency stating the date, amount charged to my credit card, chip entry, verified by pin. They briefly stopped collection action to verify with the creditor, then came back with \"Our client states there is no payment towards your balance\" and they resumed collection action.  \n\n\nThe collection agency asked for a bank statement, which I was able to provide immediately. Exact amount showed as charged. That's where I'm at right now. Let's see what they come back with.  \n\n\nThe silliest part is they're trying to collect an amount under $1k. I could easily pay it to get them off my back.

I struggle to even categorize a HISA as an investment, as it is just somewhere where you park your money. You have full access to it all the time. \n\nAs others have mentioned, CDIC will protect up to $100K of funds at a bank. Open 5 accounts in the Big 5? $500K is protected. \n\nIf any Canadian bank, RBC, TD, Scotia, BMO, or CIBC goes under, and it triggers a CDIC payment, this is as big of a headline has Lehman Brothers going under in '08. I would say it's even worse than that, as Canadian banks traded profitability for stability since the 90s.
