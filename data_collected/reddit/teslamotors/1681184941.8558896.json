The publication also points out that, crucially, Tesla reached those financials after reinvesting over $7 billion into its operations last year. The Motley Fool says that it has been good for analysts and investors to pay close attention to the automaker\u2019s main business of EVs. However, Tesla\u2019s other businesses may show promise, too.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and investors have rightly focused on Tesla's core business thus far. But there's something else stock buyers should want to follow,\u201d writes The Motley Fool\u2019s Howard Smith. \u201c[The] company's energy and services segments are growing much more quickly than vehicle sales and are becoming meaningful contributors to revenue.\u201d\n\nWhile $20.24 billion of Tesla\u2019s revenue in Q4 came from the auto business, the company also made $1.7 billion in the \u201cservices and other\u201d category. This category includes paid Supercharging, Tesla service and parts, used car sales and other ongoing services-related charges. This particular category marked 7.5 percent of Tesla\u2019s full-year revenue in 2022, and it achieved record gross profits.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Tesla is also piloting a program to open its Supercharger network to other EVs, currently available in select U.S. locations and in many areas of Europe. Tesla has over 43,000 Supercharger stalls worldwide and is constantly deploying new charging stations.\n\nTesla also generated $1.31 billion in revenue from \u201cenergy generation and storage\u201d in Q4, a hugely growing industry, as well as $599 million and $467 million in auto leasing and regulatory credits, respectively. Despite the energy business not generating as much revenue as some analysts and investors had hoped, its growth is clear and likely to continue increasing in the coming years.", "created_utc": 1681132020.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfowbl8", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": true, "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12hi9yk/tesla_begins_showing_compelling_revenue_outside/jfowbl8/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_55kmu2tm", "body": "It could do tons better in the solar business.

U-turns aren't really supported at the moment, you can force them, but it's pretty clear that trying to force them can put you in a dangerous spot.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=253) - I *think* the uncomfy pause is the result of the red sign on the right.  It's clearly not a stop sign, but the pause is roughly in time to when the sign would be better visible by the car.  I suspect it is an artifact resulting from the rain, and the car briefly thinking a new stop sign had been put in.  I'm not totally sure *what* FSD keys off of as a \"stop sign\", but I have to image it's a blend of \"Red=bad\" and \"octagon=stop\"\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=462) - I'm just going to link back to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/127zlsj/hey_twitter_here_is_fsdbeta_v1134_first/jeizzwi/) I made regarding the map data.  I'm still waiting for Google to commit my changes.  That said, you can see the map layout there is pretty much the same as Google, so I'm going to be interested in seeing what happens if/when Google commits my map changes.  Ultimately though, you can see Google things there's a traffic light beyond the roundabout, and I think it's looking for it when it crosses it, can't find it, but does a safety stop to be sure.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=489) - It keys off the car entering the roundabout and hits the brakes.  Shouldn't have needed to hit the brakes, but it did.  Honestly though, this roundabout is interesting, to me anyways, because the visualization seems to have such a hard time trying to make heads or tails of it.  Wonder how much of that was rain related, where the extra rain was making it hard to discern what was road, and what was not.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=642) - This one's interesting.  Seems like it took the opportunity to ensure that you were best placed to get T-boned.  I'm fairly positive it's related to [this bit here](https://youtu.be/jPCV4GKX9Dw?t=1761), where the car is mathing out the trajectory of the oncoming vehicle, and trying to prevent a collision.  The oncoming vehicle seems to be approaching the intersection at a high rate of speed, and the car likely thought it was going to run the stop sign.  Obviously, the bad here is that it stopped dead in its tracks, in a T-bone-able position.  Bad, bad.  Should've accelerated away.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=718) - Seemed to be a little missed, but this is the spot it slowed down at last time.  It saw a phantom cone in the intersection.  I'd approach it from a couple other directions and see if the slow down is *only* when going down the hill.  Kind of a weird anomaly there.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=870) - This one's interesting to me, as last time it seemed to struggle with a pedestrian crossing, this time it went through fine, but it never used that semi-suicide lane.  Wonder if there's not enough \"lane\" for it to math its way into there.  FSD Beta 11.3.x has been *super* slow to get into turn lanes and such, it just meanders into them.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=953) - This behavior regarding autopark still annoys me.  In an ideal scenario, it shouldn't need other cars to ping off of, but it's pretty clear that it was *something* to ping off of, at least on one side.  I'm hoping they resolve this down the road.  I do, however, find it interesting that it worked on the other side.  So, I'm wondering if the logic is to look for a *parked* car, and then pick one of the spaces around it.  So, if we look at [this picture](https://imgur.com/1HYdLSU), when the car identifies a parked car, it assumes the lined spaces around it are potential parking spaces.  So it needs a \"marker\" of some kind to know that it's in a parking lot.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=1368) - It's the same thing as at the beginning of the trip.  The little red sign on the right, once it gets in frame, the car starts to slow for it, like it *thinks* it is a stop sign again, lol, see [here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=253) from earlier in the video.\n* [Here](https://youtu.be/qfFO0Vfl4qE?t=1474) - The more I look at this roundabout, the more I see just how unstable the visual representation of it is.  It was trying to change lanes going into the intersection, seems like there's a lot of ins and outs, and it's just having a hell of a time making sense of it.\n\nAlso, you inquired about other double greens, [here](https://youtu.be/OyoaKTkNT1I?t=31) is mine.  This one does the same slow down thing, although it's gotten better over time.

Removing radar was more sensible than removing USS. The low resolution radar had come to a point of making more false positives than the camera vision network, and was an expensive sensor in the middle of a supply crunch. It was a prime target for removal as it's added value had shrunk under it's relative cost. There is a reason why HD radar is on the table for HW4, because while more expensive it actually delivers capabilities actionable by the system that camera vision does not have. Vision has already overmatched the radar stack and FSD never used it in the first place, showing it was not needed. The core issue with vision in AP just remains that the AP stack is very old now and does not implement the upgrades that FSD has done to planning, vector space detection and planning of future behavior. \n\nNow from a customer side it fucking sucks, and the removal of the value of AP+ generally made that basically a useless upgrade. You get almost all the value with AP and you may as well go full FSD if you can rather than stopping at the midpoint. \n\nAs for running out of their first mover advantage, I will go ahead and say that this is very likely to not be the case. Tesla has successfully acheived both a high profit margin and a large scale of manufacturing. Literally only BYD can be said to have done the same (and only through tremendous help from the CCP), and the OEMs are all struggling to get even their EV basics right. None have managed OTAs to the level of Tesla, none have managed to drive that much value into their vehicles, none have managed to match the profit margins and none have managed to match the production scale. \n\nAnd this is not going to change in an era where capital is hard to come by and all these companies are already frowning in dept.

I do think Tesla chose not to explore it beyond what was needed as a hedge and to gain CARB credits. A single location that was only available to a very small pilot group, and only if they scheduled in advance, and only if they paid a fee, all while competing with free unlimited Supercharging wasn't a rigorous pilot of the option. I think paid swapping would hold up better against paid Supercharging, especially if there was a way to swap in to a bigger pack and also to get your original pack back. (The idea being you leave your small pack at a swap station near home, it stays there to charge up to say 90%, you take a large pack, and you pick up the small pack when you return.)", "created_utc": 1681179498.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfs1gol", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12h7nkk/north_of_israel_ruins_of_an_ancient_supercharger/jfs1gol/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}]}]
