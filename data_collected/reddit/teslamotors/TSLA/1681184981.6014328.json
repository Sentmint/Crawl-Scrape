The publication also points out that, crucially, Tesla reached those financials after reinvesting over $7 billion into its operations last year. The Motley Fool says that it has been good for analysts and investors to pay close attention to the automaker\u2019s main business of EVs. However, Tesla\u2019s other businesses may show promise, too.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and investors have rightly focused on Tesla's core business thus far. But there's something else stock buyers should want to follow,\u201d writes The Motley Fool\u2019s Howard Smith. \u201c[The] company's energy and services segments are growing much more quickly than vehicle sales and are becoming meaningful contributors to revenue.\u201d\n\nWhile $20.24 billion of Tesla\u2019s revenue in Q4 came from the auto business, the company also made $1.7 billion in the \u201cservices and other\u201d category. This category includes paid Supercharging, Tesla service and parts, used car sales and other ongoing services-related charges. This particular category marked 7.5 percent of Tesla\u2019s full-year revenue in 2022, and it achieved record gross profits.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Tesla is also piloting a program to open its Supercharger network to other EVs, currently available in select U.S. locations and in many areas of Europe. Tesla has over 43,000 Supercharger stalls worldwide and is constantly deploying new charging stations.\n\nTesla also generated $1.31 billion in revenue from \u201cenergy generation and storage\u201d in Q4, a hugely growing industry, as well as $599 million and $467 million in auto leasing and regulatory credits, respectively. Despite the energy business not generating as much revenue as some analysts and investors had hoped, its growth is clear and likely to continue increasing in the coming years.", "created_utc": 1681132020.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfowbl8", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": true, "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12hi9yk/tesla_begins_showing_compelling_revenue_outside/jfowbl8/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_55kmu2tm", "body": "It could do tons better in the solar business.

Removing radar was more sensible than removing USS. The low resolution radar had come to a point of making more false positives than the camera vision network, and was an expensive sensor in the middle of a supply crunch. It was a prime target for removal as it's added value had shrunk under it's relative cost. There is a reason why HD radar is on the table for HW4, because while more expensive it actually delivers capabilities actionable by the system that camera vision does not have. Vision has already overmatched the radar stack and FSD never used it in the first place, showing it was not needed. The core issue with vision in AP just remains that the AP stack is very old now and does not implement the upgrades that FSD has done to planning, vector space detection and planning of future behavior. \n\nNow from a customer side it fucking sucks, and the removal of the value of AP+ generally made that basically a useless upgrade. You get almost all the value with AP and you may as well go full FSD if you can rather than stopping at the midpoint. \n\nAs for running out of their first mover advantage, I will go ahead and say that this is very likely to not be the case. Tesla has successfully acheived both a high profit margin and a large scale of manufacturing. Literally only BYD can be said to have done the same (and only through tremendous help from the CCP), and the OEMs are all struggling to get even their EV basics right. None have managed OTAs to the level of Tesla, none have managed to drive that much value into their vehicles, none have managed to match the profit margins and none have managed to match the production scale. \n\nAnd this is not going to change in an era where capital is hard to come by and all these companies are already frowning in dept.

I do think Tesla chose not to explore it beyond what was needed as a hedge and to gain CARB credits. A single location that was only available to a very small pilot group, and only if they scheduled in advance, and only if they paid a fee, all while competing with free unlimited Supercharging wasn't a rigorous pilot of the option. I think paid swapping would hold up better against paid Supercharging, especially if there was a way to swap in to a bigger pack and also to get your original pack back. (The idea being you leave your small pack at a swap station near home, it stays there to charge up to say 90%, you take a large pack, and you pick up the small pack when you return.)", "created_utc": 1681179498.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfs1gol", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12h7nkk/north_of_israel_ruins_of_an_ancient_supercharger/jfs1gol/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}]}]
