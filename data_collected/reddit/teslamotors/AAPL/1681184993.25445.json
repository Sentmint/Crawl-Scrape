The publication also points out that, crucially, Tesla reached those financials after reinvesting over $7 billion into its operations last year. The Motley Fool says that it has been good for analysts and investors to pay close attention to the automaker\u2019s main business of EVs. However, Tesla\u2019s other businesses may show promise, too.\n\n\u201cAnalysts and investors have rightly focused on Tesla's core business thus far. But there's something else stock buyers should want to follow,\u201d writes The Motley Fool\u2019s Howard Smith. \u201c[The] company's energy and services segments are growing much more quickly than vehicle sales and are becoming meaningful contributors to revenue.\u201d\n\nWhile $20.24 billion of Tesla\u2019s revenue in Q4 came from the auto business, the company also made $1.7 billion in the \u201cservices and other\u201d category. This category includes paid Supercharging, Tesla service and parts, used car sales and other ongoing services-related charges. This particular category marked 7.5 percent of Tesla\u2019s full-year revenue in 2022, and it achieved record gross profits.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Tesla is also piloting a program to open its Supercharger network to other EVs, currently available in select U.S. locations and in many areas of Europe. Tesla has over 43,000 Supercharger stalls worldwide and is constantly deploying new charging stations.\n\nTesla also generated $1.31 billion in revenue from \u201cenergy generation and storage\u201d in Q4, a hugely growing industry, as well as $599 million and $467 million in auto leasing and regulatory credits, respectively. Despite the energy business not generating as much revenue as some analysts and investors had hoped, its growth is clear and likely to continue increasing in the coming years.", "created_utc": 1681132020.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfowbl8", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": true, "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12hi9yk/tesla_begins_showing_compelling_revenue_outside/jfowbl8/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}]}, {"id": "12hexle", "title": "Upcoming Software Update (2023.12) Adds Trove of Interface Improvements", "flair": "Software - General", "subreddit": "r/teslamotors", "created_utc": 1681123577.0, "upvote": 510, "score": 510, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "self_text": "", "self_url": "https://twitter.com/teslascope/status/1645369132068794368", "permalink": "/r/teslamotors/comments/12hexle/upcoming_software_update_202312_adds_trove_of/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/12hexle", "author": "t2_evg8pr", "comment_count": 250, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_fv1x8", "body": "Traffic light icons on the map would be great.
