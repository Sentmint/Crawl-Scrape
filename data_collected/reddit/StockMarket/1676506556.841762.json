Gradually, the focus of the trend has been turning to a fundamental element, the computing power.\n\nAccording to CITIC Research, the previous growth in computing power for AI training is in line with Moore's Law, doubles in about every 20 months; the emergence of deep learning has accelerated the performance, and the computing power for AI training doubles about every 6 months; and for the current large-scale model, its training computing power is 10 to 100 times than the original one.\n\nThere are opinions that the bottleneck of computing power is not landed on its absolute size, but on the cost, to reach a certain computing power level. \n\nSo how much is it?\n\nTraining and reasoning cost\n\nThe cost of ChatGPT can be split into 2 main stages, training and reasoning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/83166ll3icia1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=229c308baf162d91fa6e3546e52cc21b79ea758f\n\nFor the training stage, according to Haitong Securities research citing Open AI computings, the global leading AI model training computing power demand doubled every 3-4 months since 2012, nearly 10 times growth a year. That means total computing power consumption of about 3640 PF-days (i.e. 1PetaFLOP/s efficiency run 3640 days). GPT-3 training is estimated to cost $5 million per session.\n\nSince the training costs are declining rapidly every year, OneFlow data shows that it costs about $1.4 million to train OPEN AI's GPT-3 model in the public cloud, and Google's PaLM model costs about $11.2 million.\n\nFor the reasoning stage, Guoxin Securities estimates the total reasoning cost for ChatGPT to meet current user demand mainly consists of about $400 million as the initial investment to build its own IDC, and a daily cost to rent cloud services around $280,000.\n\nAnd for the operational stage, Haitong Securities expects ChatGPT's annual GPU/CPU demand space to be at $70 million and $7.78 million respectively.\n\n**Possible exponential rise in GPT-4 in the future**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tr8plxz5icia1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e30b44cdb8038c7d9eae6cfa4f65bf6f6a87dfa1\n\nAccording to Guoxin Securities, the current ChatGPT model does not have access to external knowledge and only relies on model parameters for computings. However, if ChatGPT is combined with search engines, such as Bing and other, its consumption of computing power resources will increase exponentially. \n\nThe predictions for future GPT-4 are based on two scenarios, 100 times growth on parameters and access respectively.\n\nAssuming 100 trillion parameters by GPT-4, no H100 server or optimised architecture is used, the single day access requires 60,000 A100s, which means $12 billion investment for Nvidia alone.\n\nIf H100 is used, which price is 1.7 times that of an A100 server, it requires 10000 H100 servers a day to maintain the operation of GPT-4, which equals a $3.38billion one-time investment.\n\nIt is worth noting that all the current assumption is based on 13 million daily access with 1000 words of questions per person. If the daily activities reaches 100 million, or even possibly 1 billion, this also demands a 100-time growth of computing power.\n\n By the way, I've discovered a list of ChatGPT concept stocks, here is the full [list](https://tech.ainvest.com/webapp/?comefrom=6&channel=1&D=20230215&query=chatgpt%20stocks).", "self_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/112wtkj/how_much_money_does_chatgpt_need/", "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/112wtkj/how_much_money_does_chatgpt_need/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/112wtkj", "author": "t2_n6q4klna", "comment_count": 7, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_inltud3", "body": ">\"just little bit more\" \n\nAlways the correct answer no matter how much they have.", "created_utc": 1676464108.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8mk8tf", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/112wtkj/how_much_money_does_chatgpt_need/j8mk8tf/", "score": 4, "ups": 4}, {"comment_author": "t2_au07s", "body": "Have we tried asking ChatGPT?", "created_utc": 1676476927.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8nbp13", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/StockMarket/comments/112wtkj/how_much_money_does_chatgpt_need/j8nbp13/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"comment_author": "t2_bj1o6eh3", "body": "Due to the Ethereum merge, a huge number (tens of millions) of GPUs in farms formerly dedicated to mining should be available for processing AI.
