I received a call from a toll-free number that claimed to be from RBC, informing me that my account had been compromised. The caller verified that they were from RBC by pointing out that the number they were calling from was the same as the one on the back of my card, which turned out to be correct. The caller then explained that a woman had tried to approve transactions worth over $1500 from Amazon and Walmart while posing as me, but hung up when asked for my personal information.\n\nThe caller asked me to verify my date of birth, address, credit card number, CVV, and other details. He assured me that a new card had been ordered and would arrive by Friday. I was put on hold as the caller verified my information, during which I locked my credit card to prevent unauthorized transactions. The caller then asked me to unlock my card in order to reverse the unauthorized transactions, and after verifying my payment information put me on hold again. I hung up and called RBC myself, and the caller continued to call me back multiple times (12 times in the span of 7 minutes) while I was on the phone with RBC.\n\nThe real RBC representatives confirmed that they would never call clients about fraud or anything related to their accounts, and that if anyone calls claiming to be from RBC, to hang up and call RBC directly. The representatives also assured me that the information the scammers had was not enough to cause harm, and that RBC would never call multiple times until I picked up. \n\nI wanted to share my experience with you all to raise awareness and prevent you from falling for these scams.

It was set to auto bill to my credit card while I was a member and while checking my statement in January I noticed that I had been charged for September, October, November and December plus a gym improvement fee totalling around $280\n\nI called my credit card company and requested a chargeback as I had cancelled the membership in the club with the gym manager. They did the chargeback and a week later I get a call saying that \"ABC Fitness\" disputed my chargeback and they said I didn't cancel properly because supposedly I had to fill out a form I was never sent?\n\nSo Capital One said they will hold the payment until I can prove I cancelled which I can't do because I assumed that since I signed a form in the gym to cancel that would be the end of it. So now I assume they're going to reverse the charge and pay the money back to ABC Fitness as they said if I don't provide proof that's what will happen and since I have no physical proof I can't do that.\n\nIn the last few weeks I've been getting calls from unknown callers that I've been ignoring, now my wife has been getting calls as well eventhough we don't have the same last name so I'm not sure how they would even get her information except from ABC Fitness providing it to her as our accounts were technically linked.\n\nWhat I'm confused about is how they sent a collections company to harass me on a chargeback they are disputing? Obviously I'm not paying Metropolitan Credit as once the reversal goes back through they will have their money. \n\nMy questions are.\n\n1. How can they send a collection company to harass me over a debt that isn't even settled and still in dispute.\n\nAnd \n\n2. What's the legality of ABC Fitness providing my wife's information to them? We have different last names and at the time of registration she was listed as my girlfriend as we weren't married but that was 4 whole years ago.\n\nI'll be calling capital one to just have them reverse the chargeback as unfortunately I was never provided with and stupidly didn't question them having not given me a form with confirmation of my cancellation.\n\nI'm in Alberta if that matters\n\nEdit: the cancellation section of the agreement is below, please note that the original contract I signed had ended as well as it was for a 2 year term.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10y9ldi/money_from_chargeback_dispute_sent_to_collections/", "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/10y9ldi/money_from_chargeback_dispute_sent_to_collections/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10y9ldi", "author": "t2_6l23yzsx", "commentCount": 5, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_vn7z6cd1", "body": "How does this still happen?
