[{"id": "113547j", "title": "Life Insurance Application Denied Because I Did Mushrooms One Time", "flair": "Insurance", "subreddit": "r/PersonalFinanceCanada", "created_utc": 1676486250.0, "upvote": 353, "score": 353, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "self_text": "So my current life insurance was up for renewal, so I (36M) decided to see if there was a better cheaper policy out there as the renewal rates were higher than I wanted to pay. I see my insurance agent, apply for a policy. Easy peasy.\n\nI guess I was a little too honest because I noted that I had done mushrooms once on a camping trip in summer 2018. Flash to a few weeks later, the life insurance was approved but the critical illness and disability were denied citing the illicit drug use. Agent said the insurance company would not reconsider until 2026, so seven years after the zoomies I guess. \n\nFirst of all, WTF I\u2019m so annoyed. Doing this kind of drug once just doesn\u2019t seem like a valid reason to deny someone. The agent told me there\u2019s no recourse and I\u2019ll just have to apply again in a few years as I can keep my current policy for now with no issue.\n\nShould I get another opinion from a different insurance agent or am I just an idiot for admitting I\u2019ve done drugs? Interestingly though the insurance company didn\u2019t seem to care that I use cannabis often enough. Do people just lie about drug use on these applications?\n\nEDIT: Okay okay I get it, everybody lies. Just not me apparently. Appreciate the constructive responses and warnings about lying in future applications.

Telling an insurance company about your drug use is like telling a bank about your drug use.\n\nMost likely there's an extreme lack of research about specific drugs, and they are not in the business of putting a whole lot of effort into getting to know you as a person to understand how risky you are. So the logic ends up being something dumbed down like this:\n\n* Shrooms are drugs. Doesn't matter they're a specific kind of drug that works a specific way, have some amount of popularity and are widely considered safe, etc.. Fact is they are drugs, you don't have a prescription, etc... If you take x drug you are statistically more likely to take other drugs. This puts you in a bucket of \"high risk\".\n* Drugs are illegal. Doing illegal things is risky, and people who do one illegal thing are more likely to do other illegal things. This means you get put in a second bucket of \"high risk\" behavior.\n\nIt's like the whole car insurance thing.

Most people I know will skip a meal to buy their kid that present for Christmas or birthdays. To buy that dance outfit, etc. For better or worse. But hey, some things money can't buy.\n\nI was fortune enough to have parents who helped me get ahead. Between working full time, attending university, and the bank of mom and dad,  I managed to get a university degree debt free. It was meager 4 years, but having no debt, allowed me to purchase a house within two years of graduating.  Basically gave me a huge leg up when I started my adult life. I still paid for 60% of university and had full time job throughout high-school and university. But that help and no student loans, are what I contribute to helping me live a slightly less stressful life then others. So I'm tryingvto do the same for my 3 kids.\n\nI've paid 200 per kid / per month into education fund. Which still only adds up to about enough to cover 2 or 3 years university expenses. So that's $600 month after taxes.\n\nHda to sell the corolla and buy a minivan, too many car seats. That was $5000 to upgrade. 3 car seats at 200 was another $600.\n\nHad to sell 2bedroom house and buy 3 bedroom. Still small for 5 people, but hey what ya going to do. That cost about $100,000 to upgrade.  Which increased property tax and insurance  by $300 a month.\n\nI have 3 girls and felt that learning martial arts might benefit them for self defense and confidence. So enrolled 3 of them in after-school karate, program. It's 30 dollars a day x 20 days a month= 600 per kid / per month. Or $1800 a month for 3 of them. ( They are all just about black belts now, and I couldn't be prouder of them or more broke lol) I won't be here forever and in this crazy world, I have great confidence that they will be able to defend themselves  as they grow into teenagers and young adults. The stats on sexual, and domestic abuse scare the shit out of me. So I'm proud that I potentially \u0155\u2074helped them there.\n\n3 kids times about 10 birthday parties per year they get invited too. There's about 30-40, gifts to buy for them so they can attend local parties.  I swear from September to June nit a week goes by that, I'm not picking up a present for kids birthday parties. \n\n$150 x 3 = swimming lessons for 10 weeks ($900 per year)\n\n3 kids in Dance and Drama.- ( between competition fees, outfits, lessons, travel) Approx $400 per kid per month.\n \n3 Birhday parties a year, about $500 per kid by time get gift, and take a group of their friend out to a hockey game or movie.($1500 / year)\n\nChristmas x 3 kids about $1500- $2000 there a year.\n\nSummer camp $400 per kid. Another $1200 a year.\n\nSummer sports( baseball or soccer) Another $1000 a year min.\n\n$38 for me and wife to take in hockey game, $100 for family.\n\n$18 at McDonald's for me and wife. $42 with kids.\n\n$45 at Boston Pizza for wife and me, $100 when kids come.\n\n$150 a week for groceries for two of us. Becomes $300  when feeding 5 people.\n\nNew boots and snow suits every season. New skates and helmets every year x 3\n\nNew shoes, sandals, shorts, etc every summer x 3.\n\n\nBasically probably spent over $100,000 just to upgrade house and car,  money that would be in my savings if we stayed childless. \n\nMonthly after school, karate, swimming, lessons, dance lessons approx $3000 a month.\n\n$600 a month for education fund.\n\nPlus food , clothing, gifts,  Christmas, summer camps, March break camps, tobagans, swimsuits, bikes, helmets, cleats, music instruments,\n\nAs they pull into teens years, go from 2 cell phones to 5 cell phone bills monthly. Chrome books etc. \n\nNow obviously I could scale that down quite substantially.   But funny thing is I live quite a meager lifestyle myself. Rarely  eat out, and my winter jacket is 20 years old, as are some of my other clothing and my work truck. Before kids obviously all about myself. But after Kids,  it's all about them. That's just me. They became my purpose for just about everything. Probably not healthy, but I get more satisfaction paying into their college fund, then a new Harley payment monthly. More satisfaction watching how proud they  are at dance recitals, vs buying a bigger house with a pool. \n\nWill admit I'm neurotic and most of these cost are not necesassary and show my privelage of having a good double income household,but kids will grow up knowing how to swim, to defend themselves physically,   been involved in some team sports,  gone on a few vacations and hopefully graduate university debt free, if they decide to go that way.\n\nBut make no mistake, this Is all after tax dollars I'm talking about and basically my kids probably account for 60% to 70% of my monthly income. Personally couldn't think of a better way to spend it.( when I'm in a philosophical mood)\n\n\nI also hate all these people who think you shouldn't have kids unless you can afford them. You bred them, your responsibility to feed them. Was your choice to have kids, why should I have to subsidize their education, etc. \n\nHere's why for those people. We have a doctor, dentist, psychologist,  construction worker, teacher, etc shortage in our area. I'm going to invest probably over  $500,000 to a $1,000,000 before all said and done.  Which means we have sandwiches at home while they eat out.  I buy sporting equipment, bikes, summer camps etc, while neighbour spends money on a Harley. \n\nBut that same neighbour, will benefit from my kids if they becomes a doctor or plumber.  We just had 1 of 2 dental surgeons retire here. Went from 1 month wait to 1 year wait for a consultation. Three local plumbing companies. One shut down a few months ago, buddy retired. Went from same day emergency repairs, to waiting over a week now just for emergency fix. Two week wait for service upgrade to 8 months waitlist. \n\n\nSo I spend my whole life's saving raising 3  well rounded kids, and end up with pretty meager retirement, as a result. Not complaining, cant think if a better eayvto spend my money. But it sure feels unfair when  asshole that didn't want his taxes paying for education cause that's not his responsibility to pay for my kids. Or is irate his tax dollars are paying for programs for my kids, or meal plans for schools. That parents responsibility. Not his. He can afford vacations, I will never have. Meanwhile kids become adults who become all the professionals we need.  Because of people having kids, he now has access to more doctors, nurse, plumbers, social workers, whatever. But feels parents should go bankrupt and foot the bill for 18 years to raise a kid to adulthood, who will become the professional that makes his life easier and possibly save it some day.\n\nEnough rambling if you read this far. All depends on what type of person you are. Kids can be cheap, if you give them bread, water, and a few vegetables, they will certainly live to 18 years sprinkle in some love and genuine support. Then there is me here spending \u2075every last penny on mine to try and let them participate in sports and try to give them a leg up in life financially, when they start on their own. Two extremes I guess.\n\nBut yes, Kids like anything certainly come with a cost. Almost like any hobby( excuse the terrible comparison),  my budget may be $5000 to restore a car, while your budget is $100,000.  Easy to get carried away and spend a fortune on them, to the tune of bankruptcy in extreme cases. That being said, wouldn't trade my kids for anything.\u00b3", "created_utc": 1676475484.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8n83m2", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/112vfng/to_parents_how_much_of_a_financial_burden_has_it/j8n83m2/", "score": 5, "ups": 5}, {"comment_author": "t2_rohvscm0", "body": "Not to diminish anything but your kid is 2.

You can fit one car seat in almost any car unless its something like a sports car without a back seat, one child doesn't have a sibling to argue with and starts he said she said with. I was an only child and my mom didn't have significant problems with me. All the larger families I know have so many problems and constantly complain about their kids because all the kids do is argue and fight amongst themselves. This also goes on into the teenage years, and actually gets worse during those years. I've seen it in other families so even though I don't have kids I know. You can try and try to stop it but the kids will argue no matter what you do. I don't know how larger families do it.\n\nWith 2 you need double of everything, 2 bedrooms, 2 video game consoles, 2 extra smartphones, 2 extra TV's, with one they can pretty much share whatever is in the house and with one you can easily make a living space for them unless your house is really that tiny. One belly when you are batch cooking isn't that much more to feed.\n\nBaby formula has increased significantly in price since 2007 and not everyone can breastfeed, so once the child starts solids and goes off the formula its going to be way cheaper to provide food. Baby formula is $50/can here for powder at least for the largest can at a warehouse club I go to. Needless to say providing formula for 2 is not going to be cheap. Not sure how long it lasts, but it sure seems this stuff is more expensive than crack. Then if you have a child with a sensitive stomach you need to buy more expensive formula that you can't get in a store and you have to either buy online or mail order. Then the formula shortages! If you can get away with using store brand or from a warehouse club then god really blessed you.\n\nYou are also paying for double the diapers, formula and clothing, double the daycare costs. While one child may not cost you things like house and car upgrades 2 definitely will. You also have to keep up with buying things, my cousin has triplets and the amount of diapers she went through was insane, she almost couldn't keep up with buying them even with the largest packages. But with one child the things you have to buy is significantly less. With this size of family in order to have enough supplies in the house for what you need to do daily you also need significant storage space.\n\nI know you can recycle things from one child to the next, but after you get through what you can use for the second child its still double. If you have 2 at the same time you can't really do this either, its just double of everything.\n\nHalloween costumes can be free or very cheap\n\nThings like double theme park admission, double the seats on an airplane, bigger rooms at hotels will add up really fast but travel is definitely optional for those who can't afford it.\n\nI don't know how parents do it IMO unless you actually have enough money.", "created_utc": 1676482879.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8nque2", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/112vfng/to_parents_how_much_of_a_financial_burden_has_it/j8nque2/", "score": 0, "ups": 0}, {"comment_author": "t2_7r1vf", "body": "A lot of those \"needs\" are \"wants\"", "created_utc": 1676485713.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8ny6iv", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/112vfng/to_parents_how_much_of_a_financial_burden_has_it/j8ny6iv/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_c8hp8o6b", "body": "Have one kid and you don't need to consume all the things or raise costs, keep the same car, trips are easier, integrating kid into more activities becomes easier, etc. It only adds up if you accept the BS about \"a kid needs a sibling\".

The major expense is opportunity cost because society talks a big game about accommodations and equity... but we still have schools end at 3pm, constant PD day closures, ECE centres are basically publicly funded at this point but private equity with no contractual obligations to meet community need or accommodate kids. So even beyond the stalled year of maternity there is still a constant perception drag on career (usually carried by the mother) as being the person always needing accommodations and time off to go get sick kids or cover school closures of bus issues - as our gov just yanked a major school bus company license and now someone has to shuttle older kid from school to daycare at 3pm.\n\nMy youngest was born just before COVID and so was not overly socialized and had both parents working from home throughout early years. We got ordered back to the office and he did not take well to daycare. We even got him assessed and approved for inclusion ratio enhancements, but the *private* daycare operations in the area that run 90% off public funds got to decide that they were not interested in accommodation (even with more bonus public funds covering additional worker) and so we now just have no daycare whatsoever. \n\nWhich means that we are about to lose 1 of 2 incomes. What is absolutely enraging is that the government (in writing) is committing to fully cover the additional worker just for him (~$15/hour+ benefits)... but they *will not* consider the fact no daycare is available as an EI eligible reason... so instead we eat the full cost of salary loss because \"*it's a personal/family choice*\". Like, no the f*ck it is not, we are being forced into this.\n\nMy wife even has her ECE certifications. She could be that additional worker paid to look after just him if he was in a centre, but the thought of the same money going to the same person for the same kid only being at home is somehow... evil socialism? Welfare fraud? I just don't understand how it's 2023 and as a society we are somehow absolutely incapable of reasonably applying equitable and just supports.\n\nMeanwhile my job taught me for ~2 years that I can 110% do my job from home. I excelled at home and actual productivity records show it in key deliverables and closed projects, personally saved thousands and thousands per year in transportation/food, and got to be there for my kids growing up.

But I've found since then that it is hard to budget because babys *arent* consistent. Thete are so many wildly different choices and variables at play. For example:\n\nA newborn (1-3 months of life) goes thru an average of 8 diapers a day (and it also feeds an average of every 3 hrs). Just for this three months, here are your considerations:\n\n- safe place to sleep: This can be as cheap as $0 for gifted goods or a box as per the Nordic model, or as expensive as a $200-$1100 bassinet that is only meant to house it until 6 months (or until it outgrows it possibly even earlier).\n\n- food: will it be breastfed? If so that will save on formula ($30-50/pack) and bottle costs ($20/pack), but if not, then you'll be cycling through a lot more of it (no idea what the average is at the moment). Or maybe you're doing a combination, or need to pump (equipment is an additional cost). That's not also covering that the baby might need adjustments like different nipple/flow sizes for the bottle...nipple cream for you if you breastfeed, etc. It won't start solids until around 6 months, and even then you might still need go supplement.\n\n- diapers: will you be doing disposable or cloth? Cloth is more expensive initially but cheaper in the long run, especially if you also intend to have a second. But you'll be doing a lot more laundry. Also need to buy sudacreme and wipes to clean off baby's bum.\n\n- transportation: stroller, car seat, etc.\n\n- clothes (definitely don't buy new here, babies go thru these like crazy between poops, spit ups, and growth changes)\n\nThese are just the basics I can think off the top of my head. Already they vary greatly in price. Instead of pricing up to get a budget, I think it might be better to budget \"down\" first. - Basically consider how much money you're willing to say goodbye to every year for the baby's sake, and then work your purchases and decisions around that.

We met and knew right away we were meant to be. We were engaged four months later and married two months after that and I wasn\u2019t even Pregnant lol! We were on a joint account within five months of meeting each other and never ever had separate accounts. Our paycheques go into the bank, and once all bills are paid at the first of the month as I purposely set up, any extra money is a free-for-all to do what we need to do. Our kids always came first even to this day. I will admit, I am the spender and buy useless stuff often.

The bottom line is, our kids grew up happy and we\u2019ve managed to tuck away some savings. Sure we could\u2019ve been much much more well-off by not buying stupid stuff or fad items but the moral of the story is, never make money your God, and instead have fun the most you can as you could be hit by a bus tomorrow.

Sure we have them but the minute we touch them we\u2019re screwed. I look at them as inheritance for our kids only. We\u2019ve worked with investors, and every single one of them failed us over the last 29 years. Just invest in real estate is all I have to say as a wise tip.

Look at it as forced savings when you want to add on to your home, change flooring, update bathroom, and kitchen every seven years minimum. Oh, and always ensure you always pay your premium for insurance otherwise you could lose everything overnight! Lastly, always donate or tithe every year to one\u2019s less fortunate!

This way she can SEE for herself exactly what the situation is. This entire project should be decided by the both of you. Just a simple Excel spreadsheet or paper and pencil will work also. Income in one column and expenses in a different column. Make sure to include WHAT the expenses are, interest rate if any, and minimum amount to be paid. She can help by reading the information to you to document. You'll also want to ask her how much on average you spend on groceries each week, and gas for the car. \n\nNext you look at where you can save without doing without. Example: Look at your hydro bill and compare to your life habits. Are all the lights on in the house all the time. Do you leave things plugged in that don't need to be. Are you doing laundry in OFF peak hours? See if any adjustments can be made there. \n\nCable... How many sports channels do you REALLY need? How many Movie channels do you REALLY need? Perhaps you can move to a smaller package and save some money there. Think about getting rid of cable and watching Netflix, it's a whole lot more cost effective.\n\nThen you look at the things on the list that are NOT necessities. How often does she get her nails done? How often does she go to the hairdresser? If she goes once each week, perhaps she can go once every 2 weeks... or every 3 weeks. Remember you have to do this too. How often do you get YOUR hair cut? How often do you play golf? I'm not saying eliminate it, just stretch it out a bit between visits.\n\nMost important to remind yourself often... it's NOT forever. It's only for 6 months. It's easier to handle if it's only 6 mths. That time will fly by and you will have developed some good habits in the meantime. You can re-evaluate when the 6 mths are over.\n\nI also like the \"envelope\" idea, or buy a wallet from the dollar store. One for take out and one for coffee. Together you decide what is a \"reasonable\" amount to spend on coffee each week and put it in your \"coffee\" wallet or envelope. When it's gone you go home and drink coffee from there... or water. Same with the take out. \n\nI also suggest putting your credit card in a bowl of water and in the freezer. You can't take them shopping with you until you thaw them out which should likely take about a day. By then you probably forgotten what it is that you want to buy. This significantly reduces the impulse buying.\n\nThen ask her what she would like to do once this debt is paid off. Family vacation maybe? So when you DO go shopping, before you make an impulse purchase of a new pair of shoes, make a conscious decision. If I could only have one thing, do I want the shoes or the vacation? Sometimes the shoes will win, but a lot of times they won't.\n\nDo it together and there shouldn't be any fights. Sorry for the long post, but I hope it's helpful.\n\nMerlin\\_the\\_BEST", "created_utc": 1676433220.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8le9qz", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/112f2uf/am_i_in_the_wrong_for_not_wanting_my_wife_to/j8le9qz/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_fopmwzys", "body": "The issue is spending money to feel good, i used to collect comics and PC games that i don't play.

I found out his mom had bailed him out multiple times when he ran up credit cards he couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t pay, and when he didn\u2019t want to pay his student loans anymore. He had a good job with a good income but he just threw money around and was always broke. He was always buying things he didn\u2019t need and buying me things I never asked for and didn\u2019t want. \n\nThere were other issues in the relationship (which are related if you look deep enough because they were impulse control issues), but this one right here was the number one argument. It never got any better. It kept getting worse and worse until he ended up a couple grand in debt again and started arguing with me about money and not wanting to contribute to the household bills. \n\nI broke up with him. I assumed the debts of anything he had bought for the house, as it was my house I\u2019d owned since before we met. This included purchases I never would have made, like an expensive appliance that ended up breaking within 4 years. \n\nI am so glad I didn\u2019t marry him. My best friend spent 13 years with a woman who spent money like it was nothing and they ended up something like $90,000 in debt when they split. They split the debt but his ex still just blows through money and is broke all the time and complains about it. Meanwhile my friend has got his life together within the first year and has savings again. He is good with money, he just didn\u2019t feel like he could disagree with his wife. He\u2019s aware he enabled her behavior. \n\nI also know I enabled my ex\u2019s behavior in a way by giving up on discussing it with him. He bullied me so badly that after the first 18 months of the relationship I just went along with him. I didn\u2019t argue nearly as much as I should have, I just silently raged. I didn\u2019t want to be another one of his enablers and the relationship wasn\u2019t worth saving to me. It was so obvious that we did not have similar viewpoints on lifestyle. \n\nYou guys have a baby though. You\u2019ve decided that this not only is a woman you want to marry, you want to have a family with her. You definitely need to have a real come to Jesus talk about finances. Her spending habits are possibly linked to something emotional, and maybe she\u2019s in need of therapy for that. I see so many people who blindly spend in the same way an alcoholic drinks. Couples therapy might be helpful for you both if you can\u2019t find common ground on your own. \n\nShe needs to understand that money doesn\u2019t just appear. And especially with a child, you need to have a budget that includes savings for emergencies, car repair, doctors visits, and the like. Having a kid changes everything. You have to be responsible. My friend who has the money blind ex wife also has two kids and they share 50/50 custody. She makes a good salary but has a hard time spending more than $100 on groceries for her and her TWO KIDS. That\u2019s so absurd to me, that she can\u2019t stop spending money on Disney trips and clothes and vodka and Starbucks and other nonsense so that she can having money to FEED HER CHILDREN. \n\nAnd as far as the baby stuff\u2026 why are you buying anything new lol Literally everyone is giving away or selling baby stuff cheap. The baby grows so quick there\u2019s no reason to have a bunch of expensive clothes. Buying used baby clothes you\u2019ll notice many of them are pristine. People get so many clothes that the baby barely or never wears them before it\u2019s moved on to the next size. Spend that money on diapers, wipes, essential items. Maybe your wife won\u2019t get the rush of hearing that checkout beep at Target, but you guys won\u2019t end up in so much debt you can\u2019t buy groceries. \n\nHousehold budget. One account for house money. Small amount of money in separate accounts for play money. Credit cards only for emergencies if there\u2019s not enough savings.

My first thought when reading that you have an emergency fund of $1000-2000 is that this is not an emergency fund- it's next month's entire mortgage payment.\n\nI am making an assumption you have access to sub-$300,000 real estate and would require a mortgage in and around the $240,000 range with a $60,000 down payment (the latter can vary depending on your timeline, ability to save, and willingness to pay CMHC insurance of course). Maybe you need significantly less, I don't know, but with my assumptions, that's about a $1400/mo mortgage payment at today's lowest rates. Factor in the (monthly) costs of home insurance, property tax, and condo fees/maintenance, and your emergency fund barely pays for even a month's worth of fixed housing expenses.\n\nYou don't need tens of thousands of dollars, but for people with little-to-no savings, no access to a significant credit line, and \"less\" income, it's essential because usually your fixed expenses are not paying into optional luxuries, rather, just the basics, like food and shelter. Assuming you qualify for EI, you will be paid 55% of your earnings, which is near the top of the range.  After tax, that's about $1800/month. That doesn't leave much room to even feed yourself. If that 55% cannot cover your essentials, you need a healthy emergency fund. Just food for thought.\n\nTo be quite frank, you do not make enough to be taking advantage of an RRSP. It makes most sense to contribute to an RRSP for the purpose of a down payment if you are receiving a large bonus from your employer that will go straight into the RRSP pre-tax. Then you get a significant sum deposited to your RRSP and you get a reasonable tax refund as well.

It\u2019s a low stress position that I enjoy a lot, and there\u2019s a pretty decent career trajectory. I have, however, been interviewing here and there just to keep my options open and have received an offer recently from a private company. \n\nThe new role has a total comp package of ~$130k, and a bigger ceiling when it comes to career trajectory. It seems like a no-brainer but there are a few things that are holding me back:\n\nThe first is wfh flexibility. In my current role I\u2019m pretty much permanently wfh. I have to go into the office for a meeting once a month or so for big project discussions but other than that, it\u2019s going to be wfh indefinitely. For the new role, I\u2019ll have to go into the office 3 days a week. On top of that, I live almost an hour outside Toronto (I was one of those people that uprooted themselves during the pandemic lol), and if I were to go into the office, my commute would be almost an hour and a half each way, car+Go train, and almost $30/day extra for gas+transit costs for the days I\u2019m in office. \n\nAnother factor, albeit longer term, is the pension at my current role. It\u2019s quite frankly pretty freaking amazing to the point where I\u2019m considering just staying here as a lifer. \n\nBut again\u2026the new role pays more and I know that I can probably make $150k+ in a couple of years if I perform well. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve gotten so used to the convenience and comfort of working from home. I\u2019m not sure if I want to sacrifice that, even though the prospect of making quite a bit more money is very tempting. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have advancement prospects at my current role - the salary cap is just lower and progression is a little slower. \n\nMy wife also works for another government org with a similar pension plan. Our HH income is ~$190k. If we remain at our current companies until retirement in our late 50s, assuming steady advancement in salary, we\u2019ll walk away with a very, very generous annual pension. \n\nThoughts?

Having to pay extra tax because you have too much money during retirement is a problem many people wish they had. You have so much time left and the fact that you have a decent pension is a huge advantage. You are already ahead of most people your age.\n\nThe key thing is that you are saving a significant amount already and that will pay off. You will get plenty of different advice and mine is just my opinion.\n\nI would only put money against my mortgage if my interest rate is high. I currently have 2.64% so I am saving any money that I would want to put towards my mortgage in an account earning nearly double that. I will apply a lump sum if have a high rate when I renew. \n\nThe difference between TFSA and RRSP is that with TFSA you are investing after income tax dollars but never pay tax on any gains you make within your TFSA. With RRSP you are differing those taxes until you withdraw the money but you also pay taxes on everything you withdraw including your gains within your RRSP.\n\nWhen you are younger, you have less money so even though RRSP might not be the most profitable long term, it can give you quality of life short term due to the tax benefits. You have to value what is important. My philosophy is to spend money doing things you may not be able to do when you retire like travel. You aren't zip lining in Costa Rica when you are 70. Heck, you may not even live to be 70.

Also let me know if you use any of these cards and think I am not being fair in my verdict.\n\n**Wealthsimple Cash Mastercard**\n\nThe Wealthsimple Cash App enables users to claim their unique Dollar $ign, similar to the Cash App in the US, offers a free prepaid Mastercard that rewards users with 1% cash back on all purchases made with the card which can earn a nice 1.5% interest.\n\nIn addition to providing a free prepaid Mastercard with 1% cashback on all purchases, the Wealthsimple Cash Card and app also offer a variety of other benefits.\n\nSend money instantly to contacts\n\nNo monthly or annually account fees\n\nReload instantly via a direct bank transfer\n\nNo foreign transaction fees (Save those nasty 2.5% FX fees internationally)\n\nNo ATM withdrawal fees globally (WS doesn\u2019t charge any fee)\n\nFree deposits or withdrawals\n\nAdd Wealthsimple Mastercard to Apple or Google Pay\n\nUse the cashback to purchase stocks, cryptos, or earn 1.5% interest\n\n**My Verdict**: Overall, Wealthsimple Mastercard is an excellent choice for those seeking cashback rewards. I also think it is one of the best cards for international purchases while traveling considering the no FX and ATM feature.\n\n**CIBC AC Conversion Visa Prepaid Card**\n\nCurrently, the CIBC Air Canada Conversion Visa Prepaid Card is the sole prepaid card in the market that permits users to load and store 10 currencies on a single card while also offering 1% cash back on all spending.\n\nWhen buying products from international online merchants, many credit cards entail transaction fees due to the currency conversions required. The AC Conversion Visa Prepaid Card, on the other hand, makes purchases on supported international online stores in any of the ten currencies more convenient and cost-effective.\n\nCurrent Supported Currencies: CAD, USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, JPY, HKD, TRY, CHF and MXN\n\nThis means, card owners can simply load these 10 currencies at anytime from anywhere to earn 1% cashback on all their Canada and international purchases. Here is the list of CIBC Air Canada Conversion Visa Prepaid card benefits:\n\nPreload the supported currencies and save 2.5% foreign transaction fees\n\nNo monthly fees\n\n1% cashback on all transactions\n\nFree Canadian ATM withdrawals\n\n1 free international ATM withdrawal monthly\n\nEarn $10 bonus for referring a friend who joins and loads the card\n\n**My Verdict**: The CIBC AC Conversion Card is a viable solution for individuals who frequently travel abroad. It allows travelers to conveniently make payments worldwide using local currencies, while helping them manage the unpredictability of FX rates and save on fees.\n\nConsidering that this card is free, I recommend having the CIBC AC Conversion prepaid card as a backup card for international traveling.\n\n**EQ Bank Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nEQ prepaid Mastercard is the newest prepaid card in Canada offered by EQ bank. This card doesn\u2019t have any monthly or annual fee. It also comes with 0.5% cashback and pays 2.5% interest on the preloaded funds in the account.\n\nIn addition, there is no ATM withdrawal or foreign transaction fees. On top of this, EQ bank reimburses for all Canadian ATM withdrawal fees incurred by the ATM provider. The only downside of the card is that it is not available for Quebec residents.\n\nCurrent Bonus: Sign up and earn a $20 referral bonus after making the qualifying deposit.\n\n**My Verdict**: I highly recommend EQ prepaid Mastercard especially for international transactions. I can\u2019t think of any Canadian provider offering a free card while waiving FX and ATM withdrawal fees.\n\n**Netcoins Prepaid Visa Card**\n\nSimilar to Shakepay and Crypto com cards, Netcoins prepaid visa card is a Crypto card which earns 1% on all transactions in Bitcoin which can be converted to Canadian Dollar and be withdrawn for free using Interac e-Transfer. Funding via e-Transfer is free to.\n\nThe card comes in both physical and virtual forms and can be added to Google, Apple, and Samsung Pay. The card has a 1.5% foreign transaction fees but offers free ATM withdrawals worldwide.\n\nOne limitation of the card is that it initially earns in $CAD then converts the amount on the 10th day of each month to Bitcoin so the earning in Bitcoin isn\u2019t immediate.\n\n**My Verdict**: I am neutral about Netcoins card considering it has no ATM withdrawal fees and pays 1% cashback on all transactions. However, don\u2019t forget there is a 1.5% foreign transaction fee which should be considered for international purchases or ATM withdrawals.\n\n**Shakepay Prepaid Visa Card**\n\nShakepay Card is crypto virtual card which can be used with any Visa-accepting merchant where Apple and Google Pay are supported. Funding and withdrawing $CAD is free via Interac e-Transfer.\n\nThe card pays 2% cashback on the first $5,000 lifetime spending. After this amount, the reward is 1%. This cashback comes is paid in Bitcoin which can be exchanged to Canadian Dollar easily but with a 1-3% embedded fee.\n\nThere is also a 3% foreign transaction fee for any international purchases.\n\n**My Verdict**: Considering how Bitcoin fluctuates and the limitation of this card (no physical card so no ATM withdrawals) plus the FX fees, I recommend Shakepay Card only to those who believe in the future of Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin.\n\n**Mogo Prepaid Visa Card**\n\nThe Mogo prepaid credit card stands out as the most ecologically sustainable option available. Not only is it free to use, but it also offers various benefits that could appeal to those with an environmentally conscious mindset.\n\nFor instance, each transaction made with this card earns the user 50 Satoshis of Bitcoin. Additionally, the Mogo card plants one tree for every transaction, effectively offsetting around 500 pounds of CO2 emissions over a span of 25 years for each user.\n\nMogo has no monthly fees. However, it carries the following fees:\n\nDomestic ATM: $1.50\n\nInternational ATM: $3.00\n\nAdding money at a Canada Post office: $3.00\n\nAccount inactivity fee after 365 days of not using the card: $1.99\n\n2.5% foreign transaction fee\n\nNot available to Quebec residents\n\n**My Verdict**: I don\u2019t see a real benefit of using Mogo Prepaid debit card considering it charges fees for ATM and foreign transaction usages. It also encourages consumers to spend at least once a year to avoid the $1.99 monthly inactivity fee.\n\n**BMO Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nThe BMO Prepaid Mastercard comes with an annual fee of $6.95. Users have the option to deposit funds between $100 and $10,000. BMO users can load the card directly by transferring from BMO chequing or savings account.\n\nNon-BMO customers, can load the card by using the bill payment option. It\u2019s worth noting that using the card for cash transactions incurs a fee of $5, and the regular 2.5% foreign transaction fee is also applied.\n\nThere is no incentive (cashback) for using the card. However, users can enjoy extended warranty and purchase protection for items purchased by the BMO prepaid Mastercard.\n\n**My Verdict**: I understand that the annual $6.95 fee is negligible. However, considering there is no real benefit of having the card plus its 2.5% FX fee and monthly $5 inactivity fee, I don\u2019t recommend BMO Prepaid Mastercard.\n\n**KOHO Mastercard Prepaid Card**\n\nKOHO offers a prepaid Mastercard that can be used for online and in-store purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted. Additionally, the card comes with a smartphone app that provides budgeting tools, automated savings, and easy payment options through Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\nKOHO Plans - KOHO Subscriptions\n\nOne feature that sets KOHO\u2019s prepaid Mastercard apart from other prepaid cards is the ability to earn cashback on purchases. Depending on the retailer, cardholders can earn up to 5% cash back on their purchases.\n\nKOHO offers three different prepaid credit card accounts which are called Easy, Essential, and Premium account. KOHO offers different cashbacks in different categories on its plans.\n\nA feature in KOHO cards is the ability to build a credit history. However, charging Canadians with no or bad credit an annual $84 or $120 fee isn\u2019t fair.\n\nKOHO Easy Features:\n\n1% cash back on groceries, bills & services\n\nEarn 0.5% interest on your entire balance\n\nCredit Building for $10/month\n\nKOHO Essential Features:\n\n1% cash back on groceries, bills & services, eating & drinking\n\n0.25% back on all other purchases\n\nEarn 1.5% interest on your entire balance\n\nCredit Building for $7/month\n\nKOHO Premium Features:\n\n2% cash back on groceries, transport, eating & drinking\n\n0.5% cash back on all purchases\n\nEarn 2% interest on your entire balance\n\nCredit Building for $7/month\n\nNo FX fees\n\n1 free international withdrawal / month\n\n**My Verdict**: KOHO could have been a great option if they didn\u2019t have the extra $7 or $10 monthly fee for (re)building credit history. In addition, there is no need to pay $84 a month to earn 1% cashback when the free Wealthsimple Cash pays 1% on all purchases.\n\nOn top of all the fees, KOHO\u2019s customer support and app glitches have caused nightmares to many users. I don\u2019t recommend KOHO as there are better options as stated above.\n\n**We Financial Visa Prepaid Card**\n\nWe Financial reloadable credit card was initially launched in 2015 by the North West Company Inc and gained popularity among the residents of remote Northern Canada areas.\n\nThe card\u2019s direct deposit feature allowed for quicker access to electronic payments, such as payroll. The card has a monthly $4.95 maintenance fee. It also charges $3 ATM withdrawal fees plus the 2.5% foreign transaction fees for international ATM withdrawals.\n\n**My Verdict**: Considering the many better alternatives, I don\u2019t recommend this card.\n\n**Wise Prepaid Debit Card**\n\nWise is not a prepaid credit card but it works similarly to other prepaid cards so I thought it\u2019s worth mentioning here.\n\nWise card is a multicurrency debit card which can hold and convert 49 currencies. Card holders can also receive funds in 9 currencies but send funds to 77 countries.\n\nThere is a fee for sending money which starts from 0.41%. Receiving money in Receive AUD, CAD, EUR, GBP, HUF, NZD, RON, SGD, TRY and USD (non-wire) is free but it costs $4.14 USD if the USD payment is a wire payment.\n\nThe card comes with its own limitation including no Canadian ATM withdrawals. In addition, it only allows 2 free international ATM withdrawal as long as the total withdrawals are under $350 CAD monthly before charging the 1.75% plus $1.5 fee.\n\n**My Verdict**: Wise card can be a beneficial card for those who need to send and receive money in one of the supported currencies and countries. However, I don\u2019t think it is a good card for international travels considering its high ATM fees.\n\nIn addition, this card charges a fee to exchange between currencies. It also doesn\u2019t offer any cashback or perks. Hence, I don\u2019t recommend Wise debit card.\n\n**H&R Block Advantage Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nThe card\u2019s selling point is that tax refund for H&R customers is received as soon as the tax return is processed. The card has a $2.99 monthly fees. It also has a $3.00 reload fees. Interac e-Transfer which is usually free costs $3.95 with this card. Domestic ATM usage is $2.95 while international ATM costs $3.95.\n\nOn top of all these fees, the card users are dinged with a very high 3.5% foreign transaction fee which is the highest I have ever seen.\n\n**My Verdict:** Don\u2019t bother with this card even if you are an H&R client. All of us can wait a couple days to receive our tax refunds on another card which doesn\u2019t cost anything.\n\n**Vanilla Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nThe only use of Vanilla Prepaid Mastercard is to be given as a gift. This card can\u2019t be used to withdraw cash from an ATM. It also comes with the 2.5% foreign transaction fee.\n\nThere is also a $3.95 to $7.95 activation fees on this card.\n\n**My Verdict**: This card is good if you\u2019d like to burn some extra money. Otherwise, I recommend buying a simple Walmart or Amazon gift card which doesn\u2019t carry an activation fee.\n\n**Titanium+ Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nThis is yet another card which should technically be considered illegal due to its hidden fees. First, there is a $9.99 plus tax activation fee for both standard and bundle plans.\n\nIn addition, there is a $6.50 or $12.99 monthly fee for this card. Canadian ATM withdrawal costs $1.99. I really don\u2019t want to keep talking about the fees associated with this card as I am sure you are wise enough to never consider this card.\n\n**My Verdict**: I am trying to understand why this card exists or being used by anyone. The card doesn\u2019t offer any reward and users end up paying so much in fees.\n\n**American Express Prepaid Cards**\n\nAmerican Express has prepaid cards that can be purchased online and shipped to buyers directly in Canada. These cards are available in $25, $50, $100, $200, $500, and $1,000 denominations.\n\nThere is no monthly fee with an Amex prepaid card. However, there is a one-time activation fee to use the card. This fee varies based on the card value.\n\n**My Verdict**: Similar to Vanilla prepaid card, I am not a fan of any preloaded credit card due to its activation fee. Hence, I don\u2019t recommend it unless you can\u2019t find any better method of using your Amex points other than buying an American Express prepaid card.\n\n**STACK Prepaid Mastercard**\n\nSTACK prepaid Mastercard should be on the list of the worst prepaid credit cards in Canada. The card used to offer no foreign transaction fees plus free worldwide ATM withdrawals.\n\nThese two were the main reason most savvy Canadians loved this card. However, STACK self destructed itself by removing its two best features.\n\nIn addition, as seen on the fee table below, STACK charges fees for pretty much everything which makes the card absolutely worthless unless you spend minimum $350 monthly on this card which doesn\u2019t offer any incentive (cashback or points).\n\nI hope by now I am being very clear that avoiding STACK is one of the best choices you can make at the moment. Just look at that $9.99 e-transfer to close out your account.\n\n**Cash Passport Canada Post Prepaid Cards**\n\nYou would expect better than an iconic name such as Canada Post. I didn\u2019t expect to find a card worse than STACK but here we have another winner to be added to the worst prepaid cards in Canada.\n\nThe card charges $15 for the acquisition of the card and $3 for any top ups. The card also comes with an inactivity fee of $2.80 per month if inactive for 12 months.\n\nOn top of these non-sense fees, there is a 1.5% transaction fees for domestic spending. ATM withdrawals varies but the cost is $3 in Canada. FX fee is 3.25% which is considered very high.\n\nThis card can be reloaded at any Canada Post office in cash or with a debit card in Canadian Dollars, US Dollars, Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen, Australian Dollars, or Mexican Peso.\n\n**My Verdict:** Please stay as far as possible from this card.\n\n**Final Words: Wealthsimple Cash and EQ Bank Card are the best prepaid cards.**", "self_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1135bgt/complete_list_of_prepaid_credit_cards_in_canada/", "permalink": "/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1135bgt/complete_list_of_prepaid_credit_cards_in_canada/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/1135bgt", "author": "t2_9qw4qo7h", "comment_count": 4, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_drg4y", "body": "There\u2019s something you need to check before getting any of the cards above.\n\nSome of these credit cards may use the issuing bank\u2019s own FX rate which already includes a markup over the Mastercard/Visa FX rate.
