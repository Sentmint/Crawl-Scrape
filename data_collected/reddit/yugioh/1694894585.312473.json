Monsters they\u2019re actually posing dangerous threats to the research team sent out to learn about them. All can be seen hunting/attacking/chasing the teams tasked to learn about these, where with the art of Jackalope/Tscuhinoko, they are given the title Danger?

Creatures like the Dogman, Mothman leave wonder/awe at the possibility because we understand them as potential hybrids. Bigfoot, Nessy have become huge pop culture things for what feels like forever because of the idea of these strange monkey/dinosaur like creatures living among us, Chupacabra is stealing our animals and livestock. \n\nWe have a basic understanding why these creatures are actual potential threats because we can relate them to things. \n\nJackalope is easily relatable to a bunny and we can only believe it would act no different. Perhaps with its antlers it could be aggressive but honestly it\u2019s likely the former. \n\nNow with Snakes it can vary as they are one of the deadliest animals at almost any size of their species. But we can recognize that they are also docile and sometimes not dangerous in any form to us. Tsuchinoko\u2019s legend is no different than others. Many stories that consist of it being able to talk to just it being a misidentified snake that recently over ate.

Its usually the other engines that do the heavy lifting in the runick decks, so counter play often means just interacting with them, but letting a draw 2 or draw 3 resolve can be pretty punishing at times. Its part of the reason why I don't like purrely from a design aspect right now, their boards aren't unanswerable but its rather hard to stop the sp draws and they always have the chance to draw into nib/droll/whatever hand trap stops you from playing through their board.\n\n\n\nAs for going second, the deck honestly just doesn't have great tools. Look at purrely where like literally every card in engine has some kind of utility going second. Street stops targeting deli has an attach eff happy gives protection and gives multiple attacks, noir has the discard bounce two cards eff. The most notable difference is that there's two alternative win conditions for going second, you can either hsppy into an otk or happy into noir. You're just trying to clear the board and do the standard line. \n\n\n\nI think the biggest thing it has going for it is that very often all 6 cards in your hand are actually live going second.
