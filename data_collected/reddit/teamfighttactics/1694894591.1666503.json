Peaked challenger in set 6.5.\n\nThousands of hours, Hundreds of frustration and instant gratification. Still addicted, trying to get better and reaching challenger.\n\nA rank in a video game that gives you nothing on end, and warps your sense of reality. I remember when I first hit challenger it put so many delusions in my head. I thought I would get emails from Riot Games to compete in a tournament, or interviewers on my doorstep. I thought people would care.\n\nBut it wont give me anything in the long run. Im not a streamer, not a youtuber, i don't get money for so many hours, i cant buy myself a better life of it and most importantly, i don't pursue a career in gaming. So why bother?\n\nMy brain tells me to grind more, one more game, dont quit, you are good. You are in the top 0.05% of all players on the server. You played with boxbox, k3soju, souless etc. You can do this.\n\nNot only did it have 0 positive impact, it had a huge negative impact, because of all the time I wasted as a teen playing a video game instead of forming real-life friendships. During high school and college I played WAY too much. Failed out of college. It's not worth it at all. Getting that 5 second hit of dopamine for achieving some high rank means jack shit. You cannot tell me with a straight face that achieving a high rank had 0 positive impact on your life.\n\n~~If you only hit platinum 2 instead of diamond 4 due to less time to \"grind\", mommy isn't going to get angry and suddenly refuse to come down to the basement to spoon-feed you your hotpockets. I promise.~~\n\n**EDIT: I wanted to deeply elaborate that I'm NOT advising or advocating you to quit this game. What I'm saying is if it becomes too much, if it comes to a point where you are not having fun, and the only thing that matters is elo, you need to take a break. Set a reasonable goal and climb to an elo you can consistency get to in a relative time period. High rank is a very volatile term and can mean different things to different people. For example, a reachable elo for me is master. Set reasonable goals and control how much you play.**\n\nTo anyone who is reading this, stop playing if it consumes your real life. I know, its super hard. You will fall back once or twice because it\u00b4s addictive to be good in a competitive game.\n\nI want to say thanks to the entire tft team. Thanks to the designer of this miracle of a game, Mortdog. Even though this I don't like the game anymore, you are all good people, and you all have so much talent working on this game. Thanks to all reading this. It's time for me to leave this game. It's time to let it go.

Vanquisher variation\n\nA good alternative if you hit a lot of AD items. I hit a few top 2 with this comp but never top 1. It feels like Xayah is a bit weak. Maybe I itemized her wrong? Nilah's nerf hit this comp a bit, but still playable.\n\nJust please don't build Infinity Edge. Vanquisers can crit with their abilities already.
