Personally, I\u2019d have voted against for the following, but not exclusive reasons:\n\nFirst, if the union and Apple can\u2019t come to an agreement, there\u2019s a good chance employees lose in arbitration.  Apple is likely going to argue that Apple Retail is no different than other retailer on the sale side, and that the Genius Bar isn\u2019t really that different than the geek squad. \n\nApple retail pays over market and their benefits are over market compared to competitors like Best Buy or Micro Center.  And that\u2019s without even mentioning the **absurdly good [Employee Stock Purchase Plan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465915019336/a15-5624_1ex10d1.htm)**\n\nA collective bargaining agreement negotiation and arbitration doesn\u2019t start at where staff are today, it starts at zero. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of tenure.  Apple Retail isn\u2019t a career for most, so staff tenure is a bathtub curb with peaks below 2 years and over 8 years.  Few employees exist in the 2-8 year tenure \u2014 most are either under 2 or 8+. \n\nSo a union would be great for those with tenure as they\u2019ll see likely see priority in holiday bidding, shift swaps, and requests for time off.  They\u2019ll also see advantages in promotions and wages. But if you\u2019re a person looking for a short term position, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged treatment vs those who have been there longer. \n\nWhen I was at ARS, I got promoted before colleagues with years more experience based on merit which kept me there longer.  Which is good for me as an employee and for Apple as an employer.  If I saw that those first rungs were based on seniority, I would have left sooner.  \n\nI also knew that Apple also tried to balance who got what days off and it wasn\u2019t based on seniority. We had a system where you could request your priority for the four key days around Christmas and New Year\u2019s and management ensured everyone got their top priority day off and usually their top one and two. It\u2019d suck to work in retail where things like long weekends always went based on seniority.  For a solid chunk of the Apple Store employees (the less than 2 year crowd) they\u2019d find themselves working every long weekend. \n\nThen there\u2019s the flexibility of not working in a CBA.  If I had something in my personal life that I needed work to flex around, it didn\u2019t need to go through a complicated union structure, my managers could just make it work.   If I asked to leave early, management didn\u2019t have to offer it to other staff first and flexibility around things like bereavement was higher than it would be with a CBA. \n\nSure, Apple Store employees can unionize if they want but I see more harm than good for most employees, especially those who will suffer in a seniority based system.

Because the roles of unions is often codified in law to the point that laws directly refer to the most current CBA and the government often playing a mediating role, unionization efforts benefit the general populous. \n\nInstead of unionizing a specific company or worse, a specific location of a company, CBAs apply to entire industries and benefit everyone working in those industries wether they\u2019re due paying union members or people who never had any direct interaction with a union. \n\nThis makes it harder to union bust and breed resentment over dues or something similar. \n\nA lot of the above are of course generalizations and individual member states might have their own deviations or even entire established traditions.\n\nEdit: defined abbreviations", "created_utc": 1681082325.0, "edited": 1681119373.0, "id": "jfmq8vb", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12gjwsk/apple_continues_efforts_to_keep_retail_stores/jfmq8vb/", "score": 15, "ups": 15}, {"comment_author": "t2_e50p7mgp", "body": "Genius level pay in Texas was around $22/hr.

My biggest gripes are:\n\n* They keep changing the interface subtly with every update. While not a problem on phones, it\u2019s a pain in the car since you need to re-build your muscle memory every time.\n* The UI is not winning any awards for responsiveness.\n* It integrates with only a few music/audio providers \u2014 mainly Spotify, Apple Music and TuneIn if I recall correctly. You are out of luck if you use Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Audible, Libby, Google Play Books \u2014 or any other Audio app.\n* Your maps options are limited to what Tesla provides. I suppose that is expected since the Autopilot system uses those maps, but you miss out on the nicer interface of Apple Maps, or the rich data from Waze.\n* Tesla\u2019s voice assistant sucks. Who thought it would be a good idea for a voice assistant to show its responses as text? Am I supposed to read the response while I am driving? While Siri is not great, it usually works well enough if you know its limitations. I ended up installing Echo Auto in my car. Imagine installing a device meant for really old cars with ancient infotainment systems on a Tesla! \n* You can\u2019t download music. It really sucks while driving through areas with no AT&T coverage. Imagine driving through Yellowstone National Park!!\n* The music quality on supported apps is terrible - 64 Kbps or less. It stings even more considering how good Tesla\u2019s sound system is. There is a clear difference when you play from your phone via Bluetooth vs directly on Tesla console.\n* The implementation of apps like Spotify and Apple Music is terrible. Apple Music in particular keeps logging out. I acknowledge that may be Apple\u2019s fault though.\n* You don\u2019t benefit from interface improvements made by Spotify, Apple Music etc.\n* If you are driving a borrowed or rental car, you need to log into everything.\n* You can\u2019t get text notifications from WhatsApp or other apps - or respond to them by voice.\n* You can\u2019t call using anything other than the native phone dialer.\n* You have to pay for the so called enhanced connectivity.\n\nI can go on, but they key point is that interface design and service integration does not appear to be a priority for Tesla. So why not leave it to those who specialize in that arena?\n\nTesla could provide CarPlay (and Android Auto) in a windowed mode \u2014 or work with Apple to integrate directly into their console \u2014 especially with the enhanced CarPlay coming up soon.
