As such it\u2019s a rather grey area and some devs like Google like to try and find the boundaries.   \nMost obviously it prevents developers from specifically piecemealing functionality and charging for specific functions individually. \n\nSo an app that charges $2 for accessing the camera, $2 for being able to type text, $3 for landscape orientation support, $1 for widgets and $2 for receiving notifications won\u2019t get through review.   \nOn the other hand an app that charges $10 to unlock all of that and perhaps some more under a product called \u201cPremium\u201d will most likely be able to pass review.   \n\nWhy?  \nOnly Apple knows for sure, but it has most likely to do with a combination of how much effort and out of pocket cost the dev has to facilitate that functionality and how much it is piecemealed resulting in users having the feeling that they are being nickeled and dimed to unlock parts of their phone\u2019s capabilities. \n\nGoogle likes to find the boundaries of Apple\u2019s reasoning.   \n\nInitially with PiP, which they had to add a minimal amount of work to to be able to facilitate, but which I\u2019m sure they were able to justify on the basis that they hadn\u2019t figured out yet how to inject ads in PiP, ads that are essential to their service.    \nThey\u2019ve solved this by injecting ads in PiP and enabling it for everyone (in the US). \n\nNow with SharePlay which again requires a minimum amount of work on their end to support, but again they might have an argument for locking it behind YT Premium to prevent sync issues because of ads interrupting the video that is meant to be in sync between users. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that I personally buy these arguments, but at the end of the day it\u2019s not me they need to be able to convince.", "created_utc": 1681171380.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfrjfdc", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12hlp2n/youtube_premium_gets_ios_shareplay_support_1080p/jfrjfdc/", "score": 25, "ups": 25}, {"comment_author": "t2_255kyirm", "body": "I would also say that YouTube isn\u2019t just putting SharePlay behind the wall but all non-active app playback behind the wall.

I am not implying that they should offer features for free, if that is the interpretation by readers then I failed at making my point.\n\nWhat I mean is that it is at all times a choice of making the service better for all users, sometimes free of cost when they can afford to do so.

Union HR is about YOUR rights and here to protect you. \n\nIf someone assaults you at the company. Company HR looks into how to make the least damage for the company. So if it was an executive the answer might be to dismiss you or move you. Union HR looks to protect you.

If you're a seller (in this case, Apple retail employees), and you think the benefits of such leverage (e.g. higher wages and preferential working conditions) outweigh the costs of enforcement (e.g. union dues, bureaucracy, and less individual flexibility), you will do what you can to pursue it.", "created_utc": 1681157667.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfqn8ua", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12hdva3/apple_meets_with_retail_workers_countrywide_to/jfqn8ua/", "score": -4, "ups": -4}, {"comment_author": "t2_qfni96", "body": "Because pay increases are negotiated in the union contract.

Of COURSE I'd say that, its a fact. What else would I say? That Apple is spending it all on feeding dolphins hotdogs? Anyone can look up the recent 10k/10q filing and see the money is tied up. Unless you meant *you were expecting me to only state facts against your silly rhetoric?* In that case we're right back to you trolling. \n\n>But these investments aren\u2019t going to disappear if their investors pull out. And I\u2019m sure they have enough actual cash to keep their company going for a least as long as it will take to free up those investments.\n\nEither you're underestimating the **cost of doing business, number of employees Apple has, amount of taxes Apple has to pay, or amount of debt Apple CERTAINLY has to pay debt holders.** I believe it's a combination of all the above. On top of that Apple still has a money float just in case shit happens. And shit happens pretty often. Raising the hourly wage to $45 for all employees would drastically eat into that \\~$30bn cash they have floating around. Which is used to maintain day to day operations. So you are just babbling with the \"until they free up their investments\" stuff. What you want Apple to do requires those investments become free. STILL those investments are irrelevant to the point. \n\nWhen INVESTORS (DEBT/EQUITY) see Apple has randomly decided to giveaway a significant portion of its cash. They will pull their money out. They are invested in Apple for ALL of it's current advantages. This isn't rocket science. It's a very simple thing to understand. It isn't charity. Apple doing what you want them to do, crushes their investment AND exposes them to further risk in the future AND erases the advantages that Apple has- which is the reason they are invested in the company. From their its an avalanche of things, eventually resulting in those very same employees being laid off. The only other choices at that point is: filing bankruptcy, increasing prices on consumers or, a government bail out. Apple is a public company. Public companies report first and foremost to their investors. That's LAW and regulation, to protect those investors from being screwed over. Screwing over those investors is exactly what you're suggesting. Same investors that are the reason Apple was able to grow this large and hire the employees that they have. All you need is one college course in finance and one course in economics. \n\n>You\u2019re agenda is anti-union. It\u2019s pretty clear based on your silly excuse of investor pull out.\n\nYou're from california where yall project yall weirdo nonsense on everyone else. I get it. As for that dumb take, I don't have an agenda. I haven't stated an opinion YET. I have only broken down facts about how public companies work, and what would happen should Apple put investors at risk. Apple reported a supply chain issue, DURING the pandemic, an issue every other company had for a legitimate reason, and the share price fell over 10%. Obviously you lack understanding, but that meant INVESTORS pulled out of the company. Now that was for a global issue out of Apple's control. Imagine Apple actually telling investors they are going to put their money at risk, *just because they woke up one day and decided they can*?

Please explain if I am missing something and there is something fundamentally different about buying stock now but at its lower price from 6 months ago versus simply having purchased it at the lower price six months ago. \n\nMath on an employee making $50k/yr: It is ESPP grant day, and AAPL has gone from $100 to $150. The employee has contributed 10%, or $2500. They receive 29 shares of AAPL ($2500/($100 * .85)) which is now worth (29 * $150 = $4350. \n\nWhen the employee sells, they profit $4350 - $2500 = $1850\n\nAnother person has simply purchased $2500 of AAPL at $100. They have 25 shares. The shares are now worth $3750. If they sell, they profit ($3750 - $2500) - 22% taxes = $975. So the Apple employee is ahead by **$875**. \n\nNext half, AAPL goes up another 50%, to $225. The employee has 19 shares (purchased at $150 - 15%) worth $4275. Net: $4275-$2850=$1,425.\nThe other person\u2019s shares (16 shares at $150) are now worth $3600. They get $3600 - $2400 - 22% tax = $936. The employee is ahead by **$489.**\n\nOver one year, the employee making $50k is up $875 + $489 = $1364 compared to someone who bought stock at the same time.

[Samsung has not exactly been following the established pattern](https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-display-deep-dive/#hardware-and-features) with respect to how display nomenclature is followed:\n\n\n> Things get a bit more interesting when considering the iPhone 14 Pro spectrum. It houses a screen that has Samsung Display's newest generation of OLED, with peak brightness values up to 30% greater than the Galaxy S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra. Although it's difficult to tell from the chart scale, the iPhone 14 Pro's blue emitter is slightly different from the other two phones, being a tiny bit narrower and lower in peak wavelength. The green emitter of the Galaxy S23 Ultra shares the same peak wavelength as the iPhone 14 Pro, but the former is broader, which means it doesn't get as saturated as the iPhone, but it should be a bit more efficient. Lastly, the iPhone 14 Pro shares the same old red emitter as the Galaxy S22+, while the S23 Ultra uses a different set with a slightly lower wavelength.\n\n> What this means is that each OLED belonging to the three phones is an independent set of luminescent materials, so they can't be categorized with the usual generational identifiers (like Samsung Display's \"M11\" or \"M12\"). My interpretation is that the Galaxy S23 Ultra is using a red and green material stack that's newer than the iPhone 14 Pro's, but older blue materials. This could be due to a shortage of supply, or perhaps they're currently exclusive to Apple's process.\n\nSo it's entirely plausible that the new foldables housed similar emitter material, and since the iPhone 14 Pro display housed similar emitter material as the M11 display on the S22 Ultra, I do think the generational identifiers are becoming less important. I reckon the entire reason Samsung referred to the foldable display panels as Eco^2 OLEDs was to emphasize this difference.", "created_utc": 1681148755.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfq0li3", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12haz1z/iphone_15_series_oled_display_to_feature_samsung/jfq0li3/", "score": 3, "ups": 3}, {"comment_author": "t2_udu5tnna", "body": "QD-OLED isn't really in the pipe for mobile sizes and is behind AMOLED in terms of brightness.

Personally, I\u2019d have voted against for the following, but not exclusive reasons:\n\nFirst, if the union and Apple can\u2019t come to an agreement, there\u2019s a good chance employees lose in arbitration.  Apple is likely going to argue that Apple Retail is no different than other retailer on the sale side, and that the Genius Bar isn\u2019t really that different than the geek squad. \n\nApple retail pays over market and their benefits are over market compared to competitors like Best Buy or Micro Center.  And that\u2019s without even mentioning the **absurdly good [Employee Stock Purchase Plan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465915019336/a15-5624_1ex10d1.htm)**\n\nA collective bargaining agreement negotiation and arbitration doesn\u2019t start at where staff are today, it starts at zero. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of tenure.  Apple Retail isn\u2019t a career for most, so staff tenure is a bathtub curb with peaks below 2 years and over 8 years.  Few employees exist in the 2-8 year tenure \u2014 most are either under 2 or 8+. \n\nSo a union would be great for those with tenure as they\u2019ll see likely see priority in holiday bidding, shift swaps, and requests for time off.  They\u2019ll also see advantages in promotions and wages. But if you\u2019re a person looking for a short term position, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged treatment vs those who have been there longer. \n\nWhen I was at ARS, I got promoted before colleagues with years more experience based on merit which kept me there longer.  Which is good for me as an employee and for Apple as an employer.  If I saw that those first rungs were based on seniority, I would have left sooner.  \n\nI also knew that Apple also tried to balance who got what days off and it wasn\u2019t based on seniority. We had a system where you could request your priority for the four key days around Christmas and New Year\u2019s and management ensured everyone got their top priority day off and usually their top one and two. It\u2019d suck to work in retail where things like long weekends always went based on seniority.  For a solid chunk of the Apple Store employees (the less than 2 year crowd) they\u2019d find themselves working every long weekend. \n\nThen there\u2019s the flexibility of not working in a CBA.  If I had something in my personal life that I needed work to flex around, it didn\u2019t need to go through a complicated union structure, my managers could just make it work.   If I asked to leave early, management didn\u2019t have to offer it to other staff first and flexibility around things like bereavement was higher than it would be with a CBA. \n\nSure, Apple Store employees can unionize if they want but I see more harm than good for most employees, especially those who will suffer in a seniority based system.  I honestly there\u2019s a lot of Apple Retail employees who haven\u2019t actually fully evaluated the pros and cons of representation.", "created_utc": 1681183847.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfsa63r", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12gjwsk/apple_continues_efforts_to_keep_retail_stores/jfsa63r/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_9v89b", "body": "I thought the same thing looking at the thumbnail.

Maybe broadly better employee happiness. \n\nFor employees, they get some obvious benefits - better pay usually, better working conditions, etc\n\nOn the bad side, for companies it's fairly obvious. Unions will cost the company more money, and it will have a trickle down effect on their prices to consumers.

First, while you may make better money, you also usually need to pay the union regular dues. It's possible that union management will advocate for policies that didn't actually serve you or the company very well (union leadership is just as subject to corruption as company) - this can lead to weird policies and situations. In some states, if you are hired by a unionized company, you are forces to join the union, you don't even get your own say in it.

Well, now we're in a different position. She can't reasonably fire *everybody* and have an entirely new team on the floor within a reasonable amount of time. So if the entire time comes up and makes their case together, she's going to be more willing to come to a solution. That's essentially what unionizing means. All the employees have come together to bargain for what they want from their boss.\n\nBut idk if you've ever sat at a meeting with way too many people, but it falls apart quickly. So instead of literally every employee meeting in the same room with your boss, the employees choose one person to go speak on behalf of everyone. So now we have one person that can go meet with the boss, come up with a solution, and since that person was elected by everyone, he can speak for the whole group. Now we have a union leader.\n\nWell the union leader is tired. They're working a full job PLUS bargaining with the boss, listening to everyone's complaints, figuring out what priorities are, etc. It's become a second full-time job. So now, the workers come up with an idea. They're going to find an expert on their field and they'll all chip in some money to hire that person to lead their union on their behalf. So now everyone pays a few dollars from each paycheck to hire a union organizer to lead their union.\n\nWell the union organizer has an idea. He's already an expert on the topic, and he's already negotiated a contract with favorable terms for this company. Why doesn't he go to the factory that does similar work down the street and try to get them to unionize, as well. That way, he can make a few dollars off of their paychecks, and in exchange the workers will get paid more money and have better working conditions. Now we have a full-fledged union.\n\nEventually this union organizer could represent so many different companies that the union organizer might have to start hiring some staff to help him out. And now the union has become its own organization that can negotiate with an entire industry at large.\n\nSo basically in this context, \"unionizing\" means that someone who works for a company (Apple, Starbucks, Amazon, etc) has contacted one of the unions that represents industries similar to theirs.

I honestly there\u2019s a lot of Apple Retail employees who haven\u2019t actually fully evaluated the pros and cons of representation. \n\n\nResponding to your comment though, a couple comments on that.\n\n\nFirst, if the union Apple can\u2019t come to an agreement, there\u2019s a good chance employees lose in arbitration.  Apple retail pays over market and their benefits are over market compared to competitors like Best Buy or even Micro Center.  And that\u2019s without even mentioning the **absurdly good [Employee Stock Purchase Plan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465915019336/a15-5624_1ex10d1.htm)**\n\nApple is likely going to argue that Apple Retail is no different than other retailer on the sale side, and that the Genius Bar isn\u2019t really that different than the geek squad. \n\nA collective bargaining agreement negotiation doesn\u2019t start at where staff are today, it starts at zero. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of tenure.  Apple Retail isn\u2019t a career for most, so staff tenure looks like a bath tub curb with peaks below 2 years and over 8 years.  Few employees exist in the 2-8 year tenure \u2014 most are either under 2 or 8+. \n\nSo a union would be great for those with tenure as they\u2019ll see priority in holiday bidding, shift swaps, and requests for time off.  They\u2019ll also see advantages in promotions and wages. But if you\u2019re a person looking for a short term position, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged treatment vs those who have been there longer. \n\nWhen I was at ARS, I got promoted before colleagues with years more experience based on merit which kept me there longer.  Which is good for me as an employee and for Apple as an employer.  If I saw that those first rungs were based on seniority, I would have left sooner.  \n\nI also knew that Apple also tried to balance who got what days off and it wasn\u2019t based on seniority. We had a system where you could request your priority for the four key days around Christmas and New Year\u2019s and management ensured everyone got their top priority day off and usually their top one and two. It\u2019d suck to work in retail where things like long weekends always went based on seniority.  For a solid chunk of the Apple Store employees (the less than 2 year crowd) they\u2019d find themselves working every long weekend. \n\nThen there\u2019s the flexibility of not working in a CBA.  If I had something in my personal life that I needed work to flex around, it didn\u2019t need to go through a complicated union structure, my managers could just make it work.   If I asked to leave early, management didn\u2019t have to offer it to other staff first and flexibility around things like bereavement was higher than it would be with a CBA. \n\nSure, Apple Store employees can unionize if they want but I see more harm than good for most employees, especially those who will suffer in a seniority based system.

Slower input = less server cost. Also, it\u2019s kinda like an advertisement / trial for how good chatGPT is.   \n-\tthe API version: this is like a version specifically made for programs. They\u2019re expecting a LOT of requests, because it\u2019s so much faster for programs to send inputs. The other part of it is that they expect you to heavily use this, so even if you are providing data, it might not offset the cost of usage.

While not a problem on phones, it\u2019s a pain in the car since you need to re-build your muscle memory every time.\n* The UI is not winning any awards for responsiveness.\n* It integrates with only a few music/audio providers \u2014 mainly Spotify, Apple Music and TuneIn if I recall correctly. You are out of luck if you use Amazon Music, YouTube Music, Audible, Libby, Google Play Books \u2014 or any other Audio app.\n* Your maps options are limited to what Tesla provides. I suppose that is expected since the Autopilot system uses those maps, but you miss out on the nicer interface of Apple Maps, or the rich data from Waze.\n* Tesla\u2019s voice assistant sucks. Who thought it would be a good idea for a voice assistant to show its responses as text? Am I supposed to read the response while I am driving? While Siri is not great, it usually works well enough if you know its limitations. I ended up installing Echo Auto in my car. Imagine installing a device meant for really old cars with ancient infotainment systems on a Tesla! \n* You can\u2019t download music. It really sucks while driving through areas with no AT&T coverage. Imagine driving through Yellowstone National Park!!\n* The music quality on supported apps is terrible - 64 Kbps or less. It stings even more considering how good Tesla\u2019s sound system is. There is a clear difference when you play from your phone via Bluetooth vs directly on Tesla console.\n* The implementation of apps like Spotify and Apple Music is terrible. Apple Music in particular keeps logging out. I acknowledge that may be Apple\u2019s fault though.\n* You don\u2019t benefit from interface improvements made by Spotify, Apple Music etc.\n* If you are driving a borrowed or rental car, you need to log into everything.\n* You can\u2019t get text notifications from WhatsApp or other apps - or respond to them by voice.\n* You can\u2019t call using anything other than the native phone dialer.\n* You have to pay for the so called enhanced connectivity.\n\nI can go on, but they key point is that interface design and service integration does not appear to be a priority for Tesla.

You use DuckDuckGo but you can only do so because Apple explicitly enables you to use it.  Now consider a different use case.  Let\u2019s say I prefer to use Startpage. Put yourself in my shoes and temporarily configure Safari to use it by default.  \n\nWhen you realize you can\u2019t do it you\u2019ll see what I mean by inversion of control.  Apple dictates what you can use.  Firefox (for example), allows you to extend the available default search options beyond what the browser ships with.  If I install Firefox off the shelf, Startpage isn\u2019t available in the settings (at least last I checked :P).  But I can simply and painlessly add it to the list options from the search bar (Startpage even offers to add it for you if navigate there using Firefox).  That\u2019s me truly telling the browser what to use.  When you use Safari you invert control to the browser/vendor to tell YOU what you can use.  You\u2019re using DuckDuckGo by permission, not *entirely* by choice.  That doesn\u2019t fly with me, thus serves as one example of what makes Safari sub-optimal for me and for anyone else who doesn\u2019t prefer to be limited by those options.\n\nNow granted, there is at least one Safari extension which attempts to make up for this shortcoming by intercepting search requests and then redirecting to the search engine of your choice but that one extension I\u2019ve seen which does that costs money and by nature adds a layer of privacy concern as all search queries have to be captured by the extension so you have to trust the developer not to snoop.
