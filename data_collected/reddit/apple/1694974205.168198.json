Not all the banking apps are able to keep track of subscriptions, which can make things difficult when subscribed to a number of services at once and suddenly being charged without any warning. When I was looking for a subscription management app, most of them required purchase of the premium tier (or even a subscription!) to track more than 5 subscriptions at once, and some have a limited number of currencies. There was room for something better, and that's what led to me creating SubManager.\n\nRecently I have launched version 1.1, which introduces full Apple Watch support, just in time for watchOS 10 launching tomorrow. The new watch app makes use of watchOS 10 UI elements and lets you view your subscriptions on your wrist. It also brings all the supported widgets currently available on iPhone over to Apple Watch.\n\nFeatures currently available in SubManager include:\n\n- Tracking an unlimited number of subscriptions\n- Get notified up to 7 days in advance\n- Conversion of foreign subscriptions to your local currency\n- Insights based on your subscriptions\n- Free iCloud sync\n- Full Apple Watch support\n- Widgets on the Home Screen and Lock Screen\n- No ads\n\nUsers also have the choice to purchase SubManager+, a one time purchase containing premium features such as:\n\n- App Lock using passcode or biometrics\n- Import and Export to JSON or CSV files\n- Mark subscriptions as ended\n- Change app icon to your local currency\n\nSubManager+ is available for $4.99 and $9.99 for SubManager+ with Family Sharing. In addition, any new SubManager+ features will be included at no additional cost. More features are in the works and the roadmap is available at https://getsubmanager.app/support\n\nI appreciate all feedback as they do help shape the future of this app. I look forward to improving the app with new functionality over the coming months.\n\nApp Store link: https://apple.co/44Nq1XI\n\nWebsite: https://getsubmanager.app", "self_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/16kyd8x/recently_launched_my_first_ios_app_submanager_a/", "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/16kyd8x/recently_launched_my_first_ios_app_submanager_a/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/16kyd8x", "author": "t2_5n4nhzvz", "comment_count": 17, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_5n4nhzvz", "body": "Bobby has a lot of things under a paywall, such as iCloud, unlimited subscriptions, even dark mode!
