The whole system is just broken and environmentalism make believe.\n\nBut regarding Apple specifically, I will agree that they have taken some positive non-carbon-credit related steps as well, which have been much more beneficial and could result in actual improvements for the environment. However, most of those have been, objectively, self serving as well. And not only in the PR \"look at how awesome we are\" sense, but in the immediate cost savings being passed on to them as a result.\n\nThey loooooove to talk about reduced packaging and how this means they can have less waste, lower transportation related carbon emissions, etc. But that was due in no small part by removing the chargers and headphones. So not only does that save them money immediately (which of course they are NOT passing on to us, and will still charge people more money to buy them now), but by shrinking the packing, it allows more iPhones per box, which means they save money on transportation costs. Win for the environment? Probably. Win for Apple? Absofreakinlutely. \n\nAnd while I could be wrong, something tells me they save money by using recycled materials vs buying them new. \n\nApple is, as you said, one of the best in the PR game. And I'm sure they've gone out of their way to ensure that even the carbon credits they are buying have at least some nominal benefit, versus some of the more crazy scam ones out there most other companies use. And obviously they have people working there who do care a lot about that kind of stuff and certainly have some big budget to show real change. But, just like any company, the majority of it is going to be self serving. \n\nWith that said, I think one of the biggest benefits Apple brings to the world is that their devices are, for the most part, able to be usable by people for far longer than their competitors. From iPhones to iPads to MacBooks, etc. the stuff lasts, AND can be effectively used, for a long time. While some phones are basically trash after 3-4 years, iPhones can and are used much longer. In our house, an iPad will go 6+ years before we donate it, where someone else will use it. They can be great hand me downs, etc. And there are people with 10 year old MacBooks they still use as a daily driver. The longer lifespan means less e-waste, especially if it can be recycled at the very end.

Thank again. Stop with the lame conspiracy theories, please.

(Obviously radiation follows the inverse square law so this means you absorb more radiation in France. \ud83e\udd2a)\n\nThe relevant standard for EU-wide regulations is EN 50566:2013, which allows manufacturers to choose the separation with up to 25mm (most vendors standardized on 15mm because this is the maximum separation allowed under the FCC standard). The French disagree with this standard because: reasons, and specify the limits at a much closer 0mm and 5mm separation, which obviously increases absorption. However, they did not increase the absorption limits accordingly, again because: reasons.\n\nMoving the emitter closer naturally results in a stronger signal, and the SAR threshold should be adjusted accordingly - which the french didn't do, because they're obviously low-key catering to the \"*pHoNeS cAuSe CaNcEr*\" wackos for political play. \n\nAnd all of this nonsense completely ignores the fact that non-ionizing radiation has *never* been proven to be harmful.\n\nWhat this really means is that *most* phones are suddenly \"out of compliance\" with the new French regulations. ANFR themselves say \"a large proportion of phones\" are out of compliance. Since the EU is more of an advisory body and allows individual countries to set such limits individually, the EU has issued an application restriction which prohibits their usage in France (presumably until manufacturers patch TX power limits downwards as Apple will most likely do).\n\nA whole lot of French people are about to start complaining about weak cellular connectivity.

But it's not all an \"accounting fraud\" and \"ONLY virtue signalling\". Epstein doesn't explain this, or at least not well, and neither do you. Epstein's core assumption is that clean energy cannot replace fossil fuel, because they are not as abundant or readily available a source of energy. He attacks the German solar and wind energy experiment to forward his case. But this blatantly leaves out advances in energy storage technology that, in the last decade, had made it more affordable to store solar energy, at least at the house level. He also conveniently ignores a more established source of clean energy, hydroelectricity, which presently can be very easily stored through gravity batteries. Other European states, like the Netherlands and France, have run very plausible green energy projects, supplanted with the use of cleaner fossil fuels like natural gas, to tackle surges in demands. (Before you bring up growing European imports of natural gas in recent years -- I've read close to 50 market reports, most people point to the Ukraine War, and not insipient demand factors, as the cause.)\n\nEven taking Epstein's slanted piece at face value, Apple's own skit at the event does not match up to the claims in this dated article.
