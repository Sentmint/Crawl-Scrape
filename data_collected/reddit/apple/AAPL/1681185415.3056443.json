As such it\u2019s a rather grey area and some devs like Google like to try and find the boundaries.   \nMost obviously it prevents developers from specifically piecemealing functionality and charging for specific functions individually. \n\nSo an app that charges $2 for accessing the camera, $2 for being able to type text, $3 for landscape orientation support, $1 for widgets and $2 for receiving notifications won\u2019t get through review.   \nOn the other hand an app that charges $10 to unlock all of that and perhaps some more under a product called \u201cPremium\u201d will most likely be able to pass review.   \n\nWhy?  \nOnly Apple knows for sure, but it has most likely to do with a combination of how much effort and out of pocket cost the dev has to facilitate that functionality and how much it is piecemealed resulting in users having the feeling that they are being nickeled and dimed to unlock parts of their phone\u2019s capabilities. \n\nGoogle likes to find the boundaries of Apple\u2019s reasoning.   \n\nInitially with PiP, which they had to add a minimal amount of work to to be able to facilitate, but which I\u2019m sure they were able to justify on the basis that they hadn\u2019t figured out yet how to inject ads in PiP, ads that are essential to their service.    \nThey\u2019ve solved this by injecting ads in PiP and enabling it for everyone (in the US). \n\nNow with SharePlay which again requires a minimum amount of work on their end to support, but again they might have an argument for locking it behind YT Premium to prevent sync issues because of ads interrupting the video that is meant to be in sync between users. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that I personally buy these arguments, but at the end of the day it\u2019s not me they need to be able to convince.", "created_utc": 1681171380.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfrjfdc", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12hlp2n/youtube_premium_gets_ios_shareplay_support_1080p/jfrjfdc/", "score": 25, "ups": 25}, {"comment_author": "t2_1qdj", "body": "Yes!

On top of that Apple still has a money float just in case shit happens. And shit happens pretty often. Raising the hourly wage to $45 for all employees would drastically eat into that \\~$30bn cash they have floating around. Which is used to maintain day to day operations.

STILL those investments are irrelevant to the point. \n\nWhen INVESTORS (DEBT/EQUITY) see Apple has randomly decided to giveaway a significant portion of its cash. They will pull their money out. They are invested in Apple for ALL of it's current advantages. This isn't rocket science. It's a very simple thing to understand. It isn't charity. Apple doing what you want them to do, crushes their investment AND exposes them to further risk in the future AND erases the advantages that Apple has- which is the reason they are invested in the company. From their its an avalanche of things, eventually resulting in those very same employees being laid off. The only other choices at that point is: filing bankruptcy, increasing prices on consumers or, a government bail out. Apple is a public company. Public companies report first and foremost to their investors. That's LAW and regulation, to protect those investors from being screwed over. Screwing over those investors is exactly what you're suggesting. Same investors that are the reason Apple was able to grow this large and hire the employees that they have.

I have only broken down facts about how public companies work, and what would happen should Apple put investors at risk. Apple reported a supply chain issue, DURING the pandemic, an issue every other company had for a legitimate reason, and the share price fell over 10%. Obviously you lack understanding, but that meant INVESTORS pulled out of the company. Now that was for a global issue out of Apple's control.

[Samsung has not exactly been following the established pattern](https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-display-deep-dive/#hardware-and-features) with respect to how display nomenclature is followed:\n\n\n> Things get a bit more interesting when considering the iPhone 14 Pro spectrum. It houses a screen that has Samsung Display's newest generation of OLED, with peak brightness values up to 30% greater than the Galaxy S22 Ultra and S23 Ultra. Although it's difficult to tell from the chart scale, the iPhone 14 Pro's blue emitter is slightly different from the other two phones, being a tiny bit narrower and lower in peak wavelength. The green emitter of the Galaxy S23 Ultra shares the same peak wavelength as the iPhone 14 Pro, but the former is broader, which means it doesn't get as saturated as the iPhone, but it should be a bit more efficient. Lastly, the iPhone 14 Pro shares the same old red emitter as the Galaxy S22+, while the S23 Ultra uses a different set with a slightly lower wavelength.\n\n> What this means is that each OLED belonging to the three phones is an independent set of luminescent materials, so they can't be categorized with the usual generational identifiers (like Samsung Display's \"M11\" or \"M12\"). My interpretation is that the Galaxy S23 Ultra is using a red and green material stack that's newer than the iPhone 14 Pro's, but older blue materials. This could be due to a shortage of supply, or perhaps they're currently exclusive to Apple's process.\n\nSo it's entirely plausible that the new foldables housed similar emitter material, and since the iPhone 14 Pro display housed similar emitter material as the M11 display on the S22 Ultra, I do think the generational identifiers are becoming less important. I reckon the entire reason Samsung referred to the foldable display panels as Eco^2 OLEDs was to emphasize this difference.", "created_utc": 1681148755.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfq0li3", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12haz1z/iphone_15_series_oled_display_to_feature_samsung/jfq0li3/", "score": 3, "ups": 3}, {"comment_author": "t2_aiorzc5", "body": "I think Apple kinda shot themselves in the foot by naming 120hz ProMotion.

Personally, I\u2019d have voted against for the following, but not exclusive reasons:\n\nFirst, if the union and Apple can\u2019t come to an agreement, there\u2019s a good chance employees lose in arbitration.  Apple is likely going to argue that Apple Retail is no different than other retailer on the sale side, and that the Genius Bar isn\u2019t really that different than the geek squad. \n\nApple retail pays over market and their benefits are over market compared to competitors like Best Buy or Micro Center.  And that\u2019s without even mentioning the **absurdly good [Employee Stock Purchase Plan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465915019336/a15-5624_1ex10d1.htm)**\n\nA collective bargaining agreement negotiation and arbitration doesn\u2019t start at where staff are today, it starts at zero. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of tenure.  Apple Retail isn\u2019t a career for most, so staff tenure is a bathtub curb with peaks below 2 years and over 8 years.  Few employees exist in the 2-8 year tenure \u2014 most are either under 2 or 8+. \n\nSo a union would be great for those with tenure as they\u2019ll see likely see priority in holiday bidding, shift swaps, and requests for time off.  They\u2019ll also see advantages in promotions and wages. But if you\u2019re a person looking for a short term position, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged treatment vs those who have been there longer. \n\nWhen I was at ARS, I got promoted before colleagues with years more experience based on merit which kept me there longer.  Which is good for me as an employee and for Apple as an employer.  If I saw that those first rungs were based on seniority, I would have left sooner.  \n\nI also knew that Apple also tried to balance who got what days off and it wasn\u2019t based on seniority. We had a system where you could request your priority for the four key days around Christmas and New Year\u2019s and management ensured everyone got their top priority day off and usually their top one and two. It\u2019d suck to work in retail where things like long weekends always went based on seniority.  For a solid chunk of the Apple Store employees (the less than 2 year crowd) they\u2019d find themselves working every long weekend. \n\nThen there\u2019s the flexibility of not working in a CBA.  If I had something in my personal life that I needed work to flex around, it didn\u2019t need to go through a complicated union structure, my managers could just make it work.   If I asked to leave early, management didn\u2019t have to offer it to other staff first and flexibility around things like bereavement was higher than it would be with a CBA. \n\nSure, Apple Store employees can unionize if they want but I see more harm than good for most employees, especially those who will suffer in a seniority based system.  I honestly there\u2019s a lot of Apple Retail employees who haven\u2019t actually fully evaluated the pros and cons of representation.", "created_utc": 1681183847.0, "edited": false, "id": "jfsa63r", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/apple/comments/12gjwsk/apple_continues_efforts_to_keep_retail_stores/jfsa63r/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_jj5ln", "body": "The goal of a union is for a group of employees to band together and exercise collective bargaining, gaining better pay and working conditions for the employees. \n\nIn a perfect world, this wouldn't be needed.

Maybe broadly better employee happiness. \n\nFor employees, they get some obvious benefits - better pay usually, better working conditions, etc\n\nOn the bad side, for companies it's fairly obvious. Unions will cost the company more money, and it will have a trickle down effect on their prices to consumers. This can be a really bad thing if it tips the economics too much for a company (since we\u2019re on an Apple thread, I'll say I doubt it would tip the economics too much for Apple, they have such crazy margins for a retail company). \n\nOn the bad side for employees, there are a lot of potential ones. First, while you may make better money, you also usually need to pay the union regular dues. It's possible that union management will advocate for policies that didn't actually serve you or the company very well (union leadership is just as subject to corruption as company) - this can lead to weird policies and situations.

Well, now we're in a different position. She can't reasonably fire *everybody* and have an entirely new team on the floor within a reasonable amount of time. So if the entire time comes up and makes their case together, she's going to be more willing to come to a solution. That's essentially what unionizing means. All the employees have come together to bargain for what they want from their boss.\n\nBut idk if you've ever sat at a meeting with way too many people, but it falls apart quickly. So instead of literally every employee meeting in the same room with your boss, the employees choose one person to go speak on behalf of everyone. So now we have one person that can go meet with the boss, come up with a solution, and since that person was elected by everyone, he can speak for the whole group.

I honestly there\u2019s a lot of Apple Retail employees who haven\u2019t actually fully evaluated the pros and cons of representation. \n\n\nResponding to your comment though, a couple comments on that.\n\n\nFirst, if the union Apple can\u2019t come to an agreement, there\u2019s a good chance employees lose in arbitration.  Apple retail pays over market and their benefits are over market compared to competitors like Best Buy or even Micro Center.  And that\u2019s without even mentioning the **absurdly good [Employee Stock Purchase Plan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000110465915019336/a15-5624_1ex10d1.htm)**\n\nApple is likely going to argue that Apple Retail is no different than other retailer on the sale side, and that the Genius Bar isn\u2019t really that different than the geek squad. \n\nA collective bargaining agreement negotiation doesn\u2019t start at where staff are today, it starts at zero. \n\nSecond there\u2019s the issue of tenure.  Apple Retail isn\u2019t a career for most, so staff tenure looks like a bath tub curb with peaks below 2 years and over 8 years.  Few employees exist in the 2-8 year tenure \u2014 most are either under 2 or 8+. \n\nSo a union would be great for those with tenure as they\u2019ll see priority in holiday bidding, shift swaps, and requests for time off.  They\u2019ll also see advantages in promotions and wages. But if you\u2019re a person looking for a short term position, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged treatment vs those who have been there longer. \n\nWhen I was at ARS, I got promoted before colleagues with years more experience based on merit which kept me there longer.  Which is good for me as an employee and for Apple as an employer.  If I saw that those first rungs were based on seniority, I would have left sooner.  \n\nI also knew that Apple also tried to balance who got what days off and it wasn\u2019t based on seniority. We had a system where you could request your priority for the four key days around Christmas and New Year\u2019s and management ensured everyone got their top priority day off and usually their top one and two. It\u2019d suck to work in retail where things like long weekends always went based on seniority.  For a solid chunk of the Apple Store employees (the less than 2 year crowd) they\u2019d find themselves working every long weekend. \n\nThen there\u2019s the flexibility of not working in a CBA.  If I had something in my personal life that I needed work to flex around, it didn\u2019t need to go through a complicated union structure, my managers could just make it work.   If I asked to leave early, management didn\u2019t have to offer it to other staff first and flexibility around things like bereavement was higher than it would be with a CBA. \n\nSure, Apple Store employees can unionize if they want but I see more harm than good for most employees, especially those who will suffer in a seniority based system.

Apple dictates what you can use.  Firefox (for example), allows you to extend the available default search options beyond what the browser ships with.  If I install Firefox off the shelf, Startpage isn\u2019t available in the settings (at least last I checked :P).
