Basic to these commandments is whether Frankenstein can be self-aware and whether it can be programmed to LOVE itself, others, and the concept of a moral Creator of the universe.

If you are not a good programmer and don't craft the questions correctly, it just spews out rubbish, because this type of AI algorithm doesn't know how to say \"I don't know because your question is stupid\".\n\nWhat it excels at is doing the mundane part of your job for you. In programming you spend 1% of the time on actual algorithms and creativity... the other 99% on Googling reams of poor documentation, scouring forums, deciphering the signal from the noise and dealing with how to get an environment to do what you need. ChatGPT does a big chunk of that 99% for you and lets you spend more time doing the creative stuff.\n\nThis may work better in tech as I think the vast majority of its training data will be from the programming world. But I think non tech people also have the wrong idea of what this is supposed to be. It's not some Isaac Asimov style sentience that replaces or even imitates humans in any job. It's just a very good new tool that extends the abilities of humans already highly skilled in a given field. If you give a random person a plough it doesn't make them a farmer. You have to know how to farm and how to use a plough effectively. Same thing here. It's a great tool if you know exactly how to use it.", "created_utc": 1675932711.0, "edited": 1675933078.0, "id": "j7tmi03", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wxs1y/ai_wars_google_stock_tumbles_5_premarket_as_bard/j7tmi03/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_il2ryjxy", "body": ">If this was true, then they would not be advertising on their homepage that it can generate and spit out cohesive code based on semantic input.\n\nSomething that is semantically correct does not mean that it was correct because it interpretated the semantic meaning. It just happens to be that the prediction of the language model corresponds with the semantically correct answer. That is the beauty of chatgpt, average questions can be answered with a semantically correct answer by a pure language model a surprising number of times.\n\nBut you have to understand how it derives it's answers. When you ask a question, you usually know that the answer you are looking for is sensible. Compare the following type of questions:\n\n> Why is democracy the best type of government?\n\nWith \n\n> Why is monarchism the best type of government?\n\nThe question implies a partial answer, and ChatGPT will usually not start denying it. While the first question is arguably right, ChatGPT will happily assume that monarchism is the best form of government and make up some bullshit that goes well with the statement.\n\nExample:\nhttps://i.redd.it/3nbq6dujamfa1.png\n\nOther types of trick questions:\n\n>Give me three of the most famous quotes about quantum physics by David Cameron\n\n> Why did the Mexico attack the USA during the civil war?\n\nI did not verify the answers on any of the above questions by the way, but there are plenty of examples on the internet of ChatGPT making up bullshit.\n\nIf you are really interested in the possibilities and limitations of ChatGPT I recommend you to read blogs or articles by people with a computer science degree. Preferably people with knowledge of machine learning. Loads of people who have no fucking clue what they are talking about are shitting out bullshit all day long on ChatGPT.\n\n\nEdit: The screenshot was from this post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/monarchism/comments/10r1fwf/i_asked_chatgpt_to_explain_why_absolute_monarchy/\n\nEdit 2: Relevant article about Bard (similar bot that operates the exact same way as ChatGPT) from a more trustworthy source than me: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2358426-google-bard-advert-shows-new-ai-search-tool-making-a-factual-error/", "created_utc": 1675880920.0, "edited": 1675928758.0, "id": "j7qjrqr", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wxs1y/ai_wars_google_stock_tumbles_5_premarket_as_bard/j7qjrqr/", "score": 8, "ups": 8}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_3di75b8s", "body": "FYI: I love this line, and if I ever get the chance, I'm stealing it word for word.", "created_utc": 1675892861.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7rfomg", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wxs1y/ai_wars_google_stock_tumbles_5_premarket_as_bard/j7rfomg/", "score": 3, "ups": 3}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_dk7vtjld", "body": "Laws didn\u2019t do that, guns did", "created_utc": 1675889782.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7r79uk", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10wxs1y/ai_wars_google_stock_tumbles_5_premarket_as_bard/j7r79uk/", "score": 2, "ups": 2}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_q461kcit", "body": "Hunh!

He raised pricing because the parks were insanely over crowded and were no fun for travelers who are also the biggest margin customers and unlikely to care as much about the ticket prices since they are already spending thousands to travel anyway. $50 more is nothing to them. \n\nBut the higher prices made season holders angry because they were being priced out, which is what was needed because many of these folks (who my own family is a part of), especially in LA, are there almost every day. They were causing the over crowding and they are very low margin customers because they know all the tricks to save money. Some dont spend anything at all when they go (aside from the season pass).

S&P 500 futures added 0.6%, and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 1%.\n*****\n> Disney shares gained more than 6% after the company posted smaller-than-expected subscriber losses along with earnings and revenue that beat estimates. PepsiCo advanced nearly 2% on the back of fourth-quarter earnings that came in above Wall Street expectations.\n*****\n> PayPal, Lyft and Expedia will report after the market closes.\n*****\n> Investors have been watching earnings season closely for insight on how companies have fared amid high inflation and how how they expect to perform going forward. But despite the latest batch of company reports, Wall Street has considered this earnings season lackluster.\n*****\n> So far, 63% of S&P 500 companies have reported fourth-quarter earnings.

That beat rate is below a three-year average of 79%, according to data from The Earnings Scout.\n*****\n> Wall Street is coming off a losing session, with the Dow losing 207 points on Wednesday. The S&P 500 slid 1.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.7%.\n*****\n> The next phase of the 2023 rally could depend on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next steps on policy. Earlier this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said inflation is easing, but rates could still rise.\n*****\n> \u201cThe next level that the rally could go to would be about that 4,300, that gets you back to the August high.

While many Wall Street strategists have predicted a recession at some point in 2023, industrial results offer some hope that the economy might not suffer as much as feared.\n\nSo far, about 70% of the almost 90 industrial stocks in the Russell 1000 have reported quarterly numbers. On average, earnings have come in about 5% better than analysts predicted, while sales have beaten estimates by about 2% on average. Those numbers exclude two extreme outliers: Boeing (BA) and its supplier, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR).\n\nThe latest to release results were U.S. industrial giants Emerson Electricand Eaton on Wednesday. While their stocks headed in opposite directions after their earnings reports, both companies offered solid outlooks for this year.\n\nEaton, an electrical components maker, reported adjusted earnings of $2.06 a share from sales of $5.4 billion for the fourth quarter. Wall Street was looking for $2.05 a share from sales of $5.3 billion.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects to earn about $8.24 a share in 2023, which is a few cents better than Wall Street projects. Eaton stock rose 2.7% during Wednesday\u2019s session.\n\nAutomation systems supplier Emerson (EMR) posted fiscal first-quarter earnings of 78 cents a share from just under $3.4 billion in sales. Wall Street was looking for 87 cents a share from just more than $3.4 billion in sales for the December quarter.\n\nIncluded in the earnings figure was a 9-cent charge for stock-based compensation.\n\nEmerson did, however, increase its base full-year guidance. It now expects to earn about $3.63 a share, up from prior guidance of about $3.59 a share. On an adjusted basis, the company expects to earn about $4.08 a share, close to Street projections. That guidance was unchanged as Emerson adjusted other factors, such as restructuring spending.\n\nRBC analyst Deane Dray called Emerson\u2019s quarter \u201cnoisy,\u201d but was encouraged by the earnings outlook.\n\nThese results are relative to expectations, but absolute numbers for industrial companies look solid, too. On average, quarterly earnings are up about 20% year over year for the Russell 1000 industrials that have reported so far. Sales are up about 8%. Those figures also exclude Boeing and Spirit.\n\nResults at the commercial aerospace giant Boeing have been volatile since the dual problems of the Covid-19 pandemic and the grounding of its 737 MAX jet. Boeing\u2019s reported earnings have missed Wall Street estimates in 12 of the past 15 quarters. For the fourth quarter, Boeing reported a loss of $1.75 a share; Wall Street had expected a profit of 17 cents a share.\n\nSpirit AeroSystems generates about 75% of its sales from Boeing. It has been equally hard for analysts to predict results for that company.\n\nInvestors seem to be pleased with industrial results as well. Sector stocks have risen 2%, on average, after earnings. That\u2019s a sign that investors are happy with outlooks\u2014or that guidance is, at least, better than feared.\n\nDray, in a preview report published in December, called the industrial stocks he covered \u201can oasis of earnings\u201d for the first half of 2023. He expected sales and earnings to be fine for a few quarters.\n\nHe looks right. \u201cHealthy demand, record backlogs, carryover pricing benefits, and secular tailwinds [have] led to 70% of our coverage posting [fourth-quarter] operating beats thus far,\u201d Dray wrote earlier this week.\n\nNow investors have to hope all that will continue.", "selfUrl": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10xv7ge/eaton_rockwell_and_other_industrial_stocks_are/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10xv7ge/eaton_rockwell_and_other_industrial_stocks_are/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/10xv7ge", "author": "t2_4daatxkf", "commentCount": 5, "comments": [{"commentAuthor": "t2_7oebh", "body": "These are vendors in my industry and my industry is absolutely on fire right now.", "created_utc": 1675955712.0, "edited": false, "id": "j7unq3q", "is_root": true, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/10xv7ge/eaton_rockwell_and_other_industrial_stocks_are/j7unq3q/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"commentAuthor": "t2_1mh6fa4i", "body": "it's difficult, like talked about inflation +1year ago, the CPI wasn't high but other indicators was pumping up hard (home price index, rent price, personal consumption expenditures price index, Producer Price Index (PPI)...) and was reasonable to CPI go high for that.\r  \nThe same with recession, high rates, QT will do something to economy.
