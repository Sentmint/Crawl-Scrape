Advertising on Reddit costs less than Twitter currently, not pre-Elon when the costs were higher, adjusted to post Elon the costs are still higher. There\u2019s no central role Reddit plays, it\u2019s actually \u201cknown\u201d for some pretty bad stuff and people to be honest. I have never seen Reddit being associated with anything positive. Twitter can drive an entire news cycle, multiple 24-hour periods, and regardless of your personal opinion, it has played pivotal roles in numerous events that reverberated around the world. No VC is going to be like \u201cdamn I better get in on that sweet Reddit action\u201d if anyone can think of a reason why they\u2019d be excited for a Reddit ipo let me know please \n\nGlaring issue: Reddit is moderated by unpaid try-hards I have no idea how that might look to potential buyers but it would raise a ton of red flags for me. For one the cost of moderation isn\u2019t being taken into account at all, how is it legal to have a public company with unpaid workers? How much would it cost to pay them or someone with experience moderating? Do they have algorithms to mod like Meta and Twitter? Granted some of the try-hards might say we\u2019re volunteers it\u2019s ok but some might want a piece of that sweet IPO. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any checks and balances between the moderators (unpaid; volunteers) and the Admins (paid Reddit staff) beyond a vague list of general rules.

My feelings exactly.\n\nBearish case: They are going to have to \"clean house\" to get those ESG scores up. That means farewell to gun subs (especially the meme ones) and so long to any political subs that don't insta-ban right-leaning individuals as well any hobby subs typically associated with the right. I'm guessing they'll have to pad out engagement with bots and astro-turfing like they do on the front page NPC subs. Reddit doesn't get as much exposure as, say Twitter or Insta, so the extent of the bot/alt problem isn't as well-known. Ad revenue will be dogshit and investors will be angry given they've essentially excluded roughly half of the population (of actual people who buy stuff). They'll also have to clean up any sort of controversial posts across the spectrum. If you thought jannies were bad now...\n\nThe bullish case: Reddit is a great place to astroturf. The pseudanonymous manner of business here allows vote manipulation and small groups with large amounts of alts to guide THE NARRATIVE ^(tm)  in a way that appears organic. This is highly desirable for both foreign and domestic political organizations to spread propaganda. Political organizations, rather than advertisers may drive the price of the stock. Twitter was a terribly run business, even before Elon, but politicians and the orgs behind them, as well as foreign governments, understood the importance of controlling online speech.\n\nOverall: I expect a huge surge in the stock price initially as political groups jump to take control. I expect the dust to settle, earnings to be shit and the stock to tank after the first quarter.\n\nEdit: for a clear example of the bot/alt replies to control engagement,  just look at some of the repliers posting history and the fact that they offer no counter-aurgument, especially in the face of the twitter-files censorship controversy.", "created_utc": 1676469508.0, "edited": 1676470799.0, "id": "j8muaum", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/112wk4d/there_goes_the_neighborhood_reddit_aims_for_ipo/j8muaum/", "score": -25, "ups": -25}, {"comment_author": "t2_en3uzdur", "body": "Guys.......reddit has been rumored to IPO in a while...\n\n[Reddit worth $1.8 billion (7/31/17)](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/31/reddit-worth-1-point-8-billion.html)\n\n[Reddit CEO Eyes Inevitable IPO by 2020 (11/14/17)](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2017/11/14/reddit-ceo-eyes-inevitable-ipo-by-2020.html)\n\n[Reddit Takes Its First Initial Step Towards IPO (12/15/2021)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/business/reddit-ipo.html)\n\n......sort of shocked that this is the first time posters on /r/stocks are hearing about it.....", "created_utc": 1676480045.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8njjnb", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/112wk4d/there_goes_the_neighborhood_reddit_aims_for_ipo/j8njjnb/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_j5ql0", "body": "You can (and should) say that again...\n\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb\u25cb", "created_utc": 1676469765.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8mutut", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/112wk4d/there_goes_the_neighborhood_reddit_aims_for_ipo/j8mutut/", "score": -1, "ups": -1}, {"comment_author": "t2_1fcarts7", "body": "Can I get a fuck new reddit?

I\u2019ve seen numerous instances of profiles with singular motivations and posting about them numerous times until it\u2019s popular, the moderators are too stupid to care but if the site goes public it\u2019s likely someone is going to be paid a lot to care. I am not saying it doesn\u2019t happen, of course it does, it\u2019s just a really ineffective way to propagate whatever you\u2019re trying to push and the troll farm realized that, in the lead up to the \u201820 elections they moved on from Reddit completely. \n\nResearch if anyone is interested where I got the numbers from: https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2019.1661889", "created_utc": 1676502682.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8p5z6m", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/112wk4d/there_goes_the_neighborhood_reddit_aims_for_ipo/j8p5z6m/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_avt4e", "body": "wait, is that a new thing?

I don't need to feel deeply involved, I certainly don't need to be (intrusively) advertised to. I just want a place to find interesting things to read, and lots of them. The UI 'improvements' that the Web is now full of don't supplement, but rather take the place of valid content and screenspace. Your menu you made in JQuery or whatever to help me navigate the site *doesn't* help, and in fact often is a blatant obstruction. I shouldn't feel like snapping my mouse in half because the menu doesn't work right. Blue underlined text worked just fine for 2 decades.

In other words, the company essentially shares a certain percentage of its profits with its stockholders. Dividends are typically paid on a quarterly basis \u2013 or at least four times a year and are an excellent way for investors (big and small) to generate a passive income from stocks.**\n\nWhen it comes to securing a consistent passive income from stocks, it doesn't get any better than investing in dividend stocks. You see, as a reputed and growth-centric private or public company makes profits, it funnels a calculated portion of its profits and cycles it back to the stockholders and investors in the form of dividends. Now the best part is that investors can either take the cash and do whatever they want with it or be smart and reinvest it back into the company and acquire more shares.\n\nIn simple terms, the dividend yield for a stock is the amount it pays in dividends per share every year divided by the current price of that share. It basically indicates the amount of return you'll receive every year contingent on the recent price of that stock.\n\nTherefore, dividend yields can be highly volatile from one organization to another, and each yield can considerably increase or plummet on a year-to-year basis. This is primarily why many investors who aren't entirely sure of what dividend stocks to go for invest in companies that are hailed as 'dividend aristocrats.' This simply means investing in companies with a super impressive record of consistently paying dividends \u2013 typically for more than 25 years.\n\nShort for trailing twelve months, TTM is annualized data that investors can proficiently use to evaluate recent or current financial data. TTM is vital as it helps eliminate the risk of seasonality and minimizes the impact of nonrepetitive inconsistencies in financial factors such as fluctuations in expenses, demand, or cash flow.\n\nUtilizing TTM, investors and/or analysts can assess recent monthly or quarterly financial reports instead of having to go through older data that mainly contains a company's overall fiscal or annual information. However, keep in mind that using TTM charts is less effective for short-term changes and significantly useful for long-term financial forecasting.\n\nIn the US, companies typically make dividend payments on a quarterly basis. However, some companies pay dividends monthly and/or every six months. Each dividend payout is approved by the company's board of directors, after which the organization will announce the date of the next dividend, the amount, and the ex-dividend date.\n\nThe ex-dividend date is an immensely vital component for investors. It's the final date to buy and own the stocks to be eligible for the dividends on those stocks. If you purchase any stock after the ex-dividend date, you will not earn any dividends. However, investors that sell their stocks after the ex-dividend date will still be eligible for receiving dividends as they already owned the stock before the deadline.\n\nCompanies listed as dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 index are businesses that have a significantly long history of paying dividends each year for up to 25 years or more. Here are five great examples of dividend aristocrats:\n\n### Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NYSE: WBA)\n\nThe biggest pharmaceutical company in the US and Europe \u2013 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc, has been consecutively paying dividends for over 88 years and has a dividend yield of 4.03%.\n\n### Roper Technologies (NYSE: ROP)\n\nOne of the biggest technology companies in the US, Roper Technologies, has been paying dividends for 25 years and has a dividend yield of 0.50%.\n\n### Lowe's Companies (NYSE: LOW)\n\nLowe's Companies has been paying dividends for over 25 years. The company's dividend yield is 1.26%.\n\n### Stanley Black & Decker Inc (NYSE: SWK)\n\nOne of the world's biggest hardware and appliances manufacturers, Stanley Black & Decker, has been paying dividends for more than 54 years. The company's dividend yield is 1.7%.\n\n### Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)\n\nReferred as the 'king of dividends', Coca-Cola has been paying dividends for more than 25 years and has a dividend yield of 3.1%.\n\nThese are mutual funds that hold stock from different companies and pay regular dividends to investors quarterly. So, if you've invested in dividend mutual funds, the dividend payout will be made to that fund. Then, the mutual fund will then transfer payments to the investors. Moreover, dividend funds typically comprise of dividend aristocrats that have a long history of consistently paying dividends.\n\nSome examples of dividend mutual funds:\n\n* The Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund (VDIGX); SEC Yield \u2013 1.48%\n* The Federated Strategic Value Dividend Fund (SVAAX); SEC Yield \u2013 3.21%\n\nPassive income from stocks can truly help investors diversify their income streams and generate independent wealth.

Certain ETFs, like VOO, are very low risk if you just dollar cost average over time, but every single company is risky unless you have a very good understanding of the business, products, leadership, financials, etc. You could buy the best stock in the world and still lose money on it because you didn't understand it and bought and/or sold it at a bad time.\n\nThat said, it doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in single stocks. We as retail investors have a huge advantage over institutions and money managers because we don't lose clients or targets if we underperform the market in the short term. For example, being 100% TSLA would've been a disaster for any money manager a whole bunch of times in the last 4 years, while as a retail investor you could've just held through it all and be up 10x vs the S&P's 1.5x. Besides, owning single stocks is a lot more fun than owning an index fund, which also motivates you to not spend your money on shit you don't need and invest even more.\n\nThe only downside is that it requires a lot of work, and it will take a few years before you're knowledgeable enough to analyse companies well enough to determine which ones are worth holding long term. You will unquestionably lose money on some (or all) of them along the way, but if you enjoy it and you're willing to do the work, it'll be a huge positive in your life in the long run.

This is when lives are at stake. Its highly unlikely that you will die from a fire a day after discovery.\n\nSo what is more dangerous? A tank full of gas that burns and expands rapidly or aqueous Li? My gut says the tank of gas is far more dangerous precisely because of the way it would explode with a gas tank.\n\nSo when a fire happens with a car, which is likely due to an accident, I think you are more likely to die from one originating from the ICE gas tank than from an eV battery. That is unless, the eV is very poorly designed and the human is not shielded from the battery. The other issue with an ICE is there are more than one location for a fire to happen.

Not everything requires an analogy and this is why we are digging into a rabbit hole looking for comparisons that don't really equate.\n\n* There are billions of smartphones sold. The risk of danger is non-existent when you consider the amount of usage and the availability of it. How many people using a smartphone (not one of those cheap unregulated ones) have exploding handheld devices? Stop this nonsense.\n* No one said anything about an explosion. That's you speaking for everyone else jumping into conclusions. There are other factors such as reliability of the battery in the cold, charging times, battery degradation, etc., People are concerned about EV's for the obvious reasons which I will list below:\n   * It's a new product. EV's haven't been around for long other than Tesla.\n   * People have been driving ICE vehicles for 7+ decades and they are very reliable.\n   * A smartphone ranges in pricing anywhere from $50-$1,400. It's a small investment. An EV requires a down payment for most car purchases and is a huge purchase. EV's are costlier than an ICE vehicle (upfront) so people are less likely to consider it when they have a great experience with an ICE vehicle that has worked for them for decades. Ex: I used to drive a Honda/Toyota vehicle before switching to a Tesla. Honda/Toyota's insane efficiency and reliability did make it more difficult for me to switch to a Tesla. These are decisions people make intuitively.\n   * If I dislike a smartphone, I can buy a new one the next day. If I dislike my EV, I'm not going to get a new vehicle the next day.\n   * When you buy a vehicle, you are looking for safety #1. When you are buying a smartphone, you are looking for advanced cameras and improved screens. Totally a different process going through a buyer's mind.\n\nI'm not against EV's. But if I were an ICE driver for decades and love the product I have been using, I am less incentivized to switch to an EV just because it is 'new technology' and those are valid concerns. Btw, an EV isn't ideal everywhere. In some states, it's actually better not to buy an EV depending on how they source their energy to feed electricity to your charging.

There are about 20 different options at the store and we have to make sure we're comparing apples to apples. Every component of the market basket has to be the same otherwise the calculation will be biased. But also there's a geographic component. They need to look at every metro area, gather the appropriate data for that item & region, and validate that it matches the intended product. For every single item in a 200-item basket of goods. Then there are adjustments for seasonality and population. \n\nThat process has plenty of room for human error, but I actually think the biggest hurdle is data quality. The state of data reporting in this country is very, very poor. E.g. it says on the website an item costs $X but you get to the store and it actually costs $Y. That means you pretty much need to have actual humans going to the stores to verify prices.

To \u2018fix\u2019 inflation you need to reduce money or increase goods.\n\nBasically, when the Fed raises the interest rate, they are determining the \u2018price\u2019 of money. How costly it is for banks to get more money. This is a simplified way of explaining it. But when money costs more, Banks are more likely to hold onto it. And what do banks do with their money? They loan it out. When this happens, getting any type of loan is harder for companies, people and sometimes government.\n\nWhich takes us back to what commenter above got wrong. When it\u2019s harder to get money, do you spend more money??? No, you spend less money. And yes certain things get more expensive, but that\u2019s also the point in a way. Loans get expensive so people don\u2019t buy houses, cars, etc. Loans get expensive so businesses are less likely to expand themselves. All of this makes the actual items being bought cheaper, because nobody has the money to buy and suppliers still want to sell. \n\nLess things being bought/sold means less money is chasing more goods. The cost of money and less bank loans have a indirect effect on lots of other goods/services too. But generally expensive money = less money = less being bought.

Berkshire initial investment is now \u201cworth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That\u2019s a pretty good rate of return,\u201d said Warren Buffett\u2019s longtime investment partner.\n\nBYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.\n\n\u201cAt the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It\u2019s not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it\u2019s a very remarkable company,\u201d Munger said.\n\nMunger, Berkshire\u2019s vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.\n\nAsked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.\n\n\u201cTesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it\u2019s almost ridiculous,\u201d Munger said.\n\nBYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.\n\n\u201cBYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China.

This is presented just to spur discussion of different names.\n\nWho are they?\n\nGentex has several products, but most well known (and their largest segment by far) is their self dimming mirrors. They control about 90% of the market for self dimming mirrors in automobiles. This product also makes up about 98% of revenues (more on that later). They also make fire protection equipment and aircraft windows.\n\nWhat is their moat?\n\nAuto dimming mirrors. That's pretty much the company as of now. While they are dominate in the market, self dimming mirrors are only in about 36% of light autos produced today. Gentex would love to see that number go up as the technology migrates into lower level cars. Controlling 90% of the market would make it a big challenge for another supplier to develop a significantly better technology that would make OEMs want to switch. Morningstar gives this a narrow moat rating, which I think is fair.\n\nWhere will their growth come from?\n\nAs discussed, wider use of self dimming mirrors would be a huge boon to the company. This is the easiest growth as it involves putting an existing product in more things. \n\nThey have additionally been moving into aircraft windows. Their self dimming technology is used on the Boeing 787 and 777x. Due to the long cycle time of airframe designs, this is a limited field (they logged about 5% growth in this segment last year). However, if their windows make it into the next generation of narrow body aircraft, this could be a big runway. \n\nThey also are breaking into medical devices. Using their lighting technology they have developed lights that adjust with a surgeons vision. This is a promising field that could diversify the company.\n\nWhat are their risks?\n\nConcentration is the biggest risk, in my opinion. Having so much of your revenue in one field can be ripe for disruption.  So far, no one has come close, but it is a risk. There could also be technology that replaces mirrors, such as cameras. Currently this is not allowed in the US, but some countries have allowed this. However, cameras are heavier and more expensive than mirrors, so it is not clear if OEMs want to change. Lastly, full self driving would eliminate the need for mirrors. I am of the opinion that full FSD, without the option for human control, is at least a decade away. As long as the option for human control exists, cars will need mirrors. So this is a long term risk, but not one that I am prepared to look at now.\n\nWhy is this company so great?\n\nGentex has a pristine balance sheet. They carry no debt as of right now and have great cash flows. ROE and ROIC are in the high teens, occasionally touching the low 20s. Gross margins are 33%, which actually went down a bit during the pandemic. They fund R&D, as well as pay a dividend and buyback shares. The current dividend is 1.7%. They consistently buy back shares and lower share count. The share count peaked in 2012 at 290 million, and is now down to 233 million. That is about a 23%  reduction in share count in 10 years. Not to shabby. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last few years have been a little soft for Gentex, as auto production slowed during the semiconductor shortage. As a result the stock is a little beat down right now. Most fair value estimates are in the mid $30s, and its currently trading at $28.50, so possibly a slight discount. Most analysts hav this company growing EPS around 15% annually, which is solid growth from an established company.

It had a bumpier ride against other currencies following the CPI data, but seems to be pausing following a January slide.\n\nThe dollar index against other major currencies was steady at 103.4.\n\nThe Australian dollar eased a bit to $0.6938 even as central bank Governor Philip Lowe said rates would need to rise further to contain inflation in remarks to a parliamentary committee.\n\nChina's central bank ramped up medium-term liquidity injections as it rolled over maturing policy loans on Wednesday, while keeping the interest rate unchanged, matching market expectations. But the mainland's stock markets slid broadly by early afternoon as investors wait for more signs of whether an expected economic recovery is gaining traction.\n\nOil prices fell as traders worried about mounting supplies and weakening demand. U.S. crude dipped 0.86% to $78.38 a barrel. Brent crude fell to $84.87.\n\nGold gave up some early gains by afternoon. Spot gold traded at $1847.5085 per ounce.

Below are my notes for the speech. The inflation number likely doesn't include today's CPI.\n\n[https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214)\n\nThis is a very good breakdown of how the Fed views inflation, and how they factor it into their rate hike decision going forward. I'd highly encourage people to read this if you need a primer on the current outlook for inflation.\n\nI've highlighted notable quotes below. She also talked about financial condition, and the market's still trying to analyze what financial condition metrics the Fed monitors. This is because of Powell's comments of \"financial conditions have been steady\" when most financial condition metrics by the market show considerable loosening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather **whether the progress will continue**. **Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time**?\n\nfor the last three months of 2022, **headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent**. However, **a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities**. **Energy prices**, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, **fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022**. But while it\u2019s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, **energy prices can\u2019t keep falling at this rate forever.**\n\n**Core inflation**, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has **historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future**. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver. \"\n\n**we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces**: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. **This last category makes up about half of personal consumption** and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.\n\n**Core goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices**. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can\u2019t recover twice, so **I don\u2019t see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable**. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we\u2019ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.\n\nBecause rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, i**t takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation**. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.\n\nThe larger concern is with services other than housing. **Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement**. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.\n\n**If core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range**, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, **total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent** than to our 2 percent goal. And **depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher**. For example, the Dallas Fed\u2019s business contacts tell us that **China\u2019s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year** by more than what most people currently expect.\n\nBut in addition, because **services prices depend substantially on labor costs**, the outlook for sustainably **returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.**\n\non average over the past half-year, the **economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high**.\n\nAnother sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, t**here were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person** in the United States. That is **down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person** last March. And it is **well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019\u2014which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.**\n\nstrong labor market has been driving up **wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent** by a variety of measures.\n\nOver time, to be **able to buy more goods and services with their wages,** workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, **labor productivity must rise**.\n\nIn the long run, **if companies\u2019 profit margins**\u2014or, more precisely, capital\u2019s share of income\u2014are **stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.**\n\nFalling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.\n\nBut for **5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation** on a sustained basis, **productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then**.\n\nAbsent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the **Dallas Fed\u2019s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023,** which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs\n\n**To achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease**\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. **Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers**. So have structural challenges like the l**ack of child care for working parents**. And **immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply**. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often **lack the necessary training or skills**.\n\nBoth of these tools **push up interest rates for consumers and companies** throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal **Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points**, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, **real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent**\n\nThe **most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check**. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.\n\nwhen **central banks aren\u2019t sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation**, the **road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced**. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way\n\nAt the same time, if **we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation.** Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.\n\n**we shouldn\u2019t lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates**\n\nThe **evidence I\u2019m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook** includes some **further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics**, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors\u2014like the **imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market**\u2014that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the **economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook**.\n\nI will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, **financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability**. We must remain **prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions**. And **even after we have enough evidence that we don\u2019t need to raise rates at some future meeting, we\u2019ll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.**", "self_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1129an6/fed_lorie_logan_supply_chains_cant_recover_twice/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1129an6/fed_lorie_logan_supply_chains_cant_recover_twice/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/1129an6", "author": "t2_63mj6ekk", "comment_count": 34, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_8hgpwtd3", "body": "That was an excellent speech.

Then let\u2019s assume you\u2019re making the minimum payment (about 400$) for 10 years that principle loan value wouldn\u2019t be paid in the way you\u2019re talking about until about 7ish years of minimum payments. So in 7 years that 30k needs to stay at the same dollar value as it did after 4 years of inflation. This is just for 1 year of loans. I\u2019m not denying that the government might end up making some money in the long term if you pay faster than the minimum payment but that requires you making enough money to shoulder more than the minimum payment. \n\nTake this out of the public loan market (where banks and universities get involved) and it gets even more complex because you\u2019re being rated at the risk they are willing to take that you\u2019ll pay it back and we shouldn\u2019t be punishing banks and universities for taking GOOD bets and giving money to people who needed it that made good money while rewarding individuals who took on BAD debt to not make enough money to the point of ruin. At this same time collections agencies and other banks are trading that debt/leveraging it for the future (think mortgages). Clearing that debt by erasure, which was made between two consenting adults and rated appropriate to the odds of default, punishes everyone involved in that market. \n\nThese are just some things to consider 1) you haven\u2019t actually paid your debt in full once it\u2019s hit the initial amount you borrowed 2) debts are rated based on likelihood of default because loan givers are taking on a risk of you not paying back 3) youre actively punishing people for making good loans because some people made bad loans 4) you\u2019re allowing banks and universities to make it out of this situation with no financial damages because they aren\u2019t held accountable for their bad loans 5) you\u2019re going to be requiring the collective, through new taxes and fee recovery plans from banks, to shoulder the burden of people who made bad financial decisions when taking out hundreds of thousands of dollars in bad debt to either do bad in school or get degrees that weren\u2019t economically viable and 6) you\u2019re going to end up restricting the money supply to people who cannot afford college, ironically, to the wealthy in society because debt is how poorer people finance college and this policy discourages lending to risker (I.e less wealthy) students.\n\nI think everyone in America right now understand that there 100% is a problem with student debt, in my opinion primarily due to lending to students with non-viable degrees, but erasure is a really bad idea that will cause much more damage than it will alleviate. There needs to be an alternative that punishes bad lenders enough to keep them from repeating the same bad practices while also making sure we don\u2019t reward mass fiscal irresponsibility. One thing I think is tying repayment plans for student loans directly to post-graduation income, if you make a bad loan then the banks/university eats the cost because you aren\u2019t making enough money to pay them back aside from low payments but if it\u2019s a good loan then they make their money back with some profit. This obviously hurts arts and humanities, but that just means the government would need to encourage more subsidies. There also is the fact that we desperately need workers in fields that don\u2019t require a degree which we 1) socially ostracize and 2) make unnecessarily competitive with other policies. Making those types of jobs more appealing through better social lives in peoples late teens/early 20s and by giving them more job security would help a ton. \n\n\nAlso I\u2019m not a policy maker, just a dude online.", "created_utc": 1676483997.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8ntr0d", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1126opb/the_student_loan_pause_and_the_effect_on_stocks/j8ntr0d/", "score": 1, "ups": 1}, {"comment_author": "t2_bhcln", "body": "That\u2019s so awesome, congratulations", "created_utc": 1676463839.0, "edited": false, "id": "j8mjsxm", "is_root": false, "is_submitter": false, "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1126opb/the_student_loan_pause_and_the_effect_on_stocks/j8mjsxm/", "score": 4, "ups": 4}, {"comment_author": "t2_5o3fiqfp", "body": "Not paying off anything.

Coke said its unit case volume, which strips out the impact of currency and price changes, fell 1% in its fourth quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\n\nEarnings per share: 45 cents adjusted vs. 45 cents expected\n\n\nRevenue: $10.13 billion vs. $10.02 billion expected\n\n\nThe beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.03 billion, or 47 cents per share, down from $2.41 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding an impairment charge tied to its Russian business and other items, Coke earned 45 cents per share.\n\nNet sales rose 7% to $10.13 billion, driven by 12% growth in pricing and a more expensive mix of drinks sold.\n\nUnit case volume was flat in North America and slipped 5% in its Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. CEO James Quincey said last quarter that European consumers were changing their behavior in response to soaring inflation.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the European economy is going to avoid a technical recession, but clearly consumer demand is softening, and I think that\u2019s likely to continue into the rest of the year,\u201d he said on Tuesday.\n\nHe added that Coca-Cola\u2019s U.S. business is still performing well and the reopening of China will likely boost sales this year.\n\nThe Atlanta-based company has been using a two-pronged strategy to appeal to a wide range of consumers. In addition to raising prices, it\u2019s also been trying to offer more affordable options targeted at lower-income customers. Quincey also said that the company has to \u201cearn the right to take price.\u201d\n\nBoth Coke\u2019s sparkling soft drinks segment and its water, sports, coffee and tea division reported flat volume for the quarter, although there were some bright spots. Coke Zero Sugar\u2019s volume climbed 9%, and its coffee business saw volume increase 11% as the company expanded its Costa brand.\n\nThe weakest spot was Coke\u2019s juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages segment, which saw its volume shrink 7% in the quarter. The company said the suspension of its Russian business weighed on the division.\n\nFor 2023, Coke projects comparable revenue growth of 3% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 4% to 5%. Wall Street was forecasting revenue growth of 3.9% and earnings per share growth of 3% for the year.\n\n\u201cInflation is likely to moderate as we go through the year, and therefore we expect the rate in which prices are going to increase will start to moderate and become more normal by the end of the year,\u201d James said on CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Tuesday.", "self_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1127fr1/cocacola_earnings_revenue_rises_in_fourth_quarter/", "permalink": "/r/stocks/comments/1127fr1/cocacola_earnings_revenue_rises_in_fourth_quarter/", "shortlink": "https://redd.it/1127fr1", "author": "t2_mc7q2", "comment_count": 96, "comments": [{"comment_author": "t2_j15wp", "body": "I guess so coke is $7 a 12 pack here in Louisiana.
